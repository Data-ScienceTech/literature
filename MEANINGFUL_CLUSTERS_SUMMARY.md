# üéØ Meaningful IS Research Streams - Analysis Summary

## The Problem We Solved

### ‚ùå Before: Generic OpenAlex Keywords
- Keywords like "Paleontology", "Biology", "Microeconomics", "Context (archaeology)"
- These are OpenAlex's broad academic classification system
- **NOT meaningful for IS research** - too generic, interdisciplinary noise

### ‚úÖ Now: Actual IS Research Themes
- Extracted from **paper titles + abstracts** using TF-IDF analysis
- Filtered IS-specific stopwords (including "jats", "information", "system", etc.)
- **Combined citation data** (OpenAlex + CrossRef) for accurate impact metrics
- Meaningful themes like "Technology Adoption", "Security & Privacy", "Digital Transformation"

## Methodology

### 1. **Text Processing**
- Extracted titles and abstracts from 8,101 papers
- Title weighted 3x (more representative of theme)
- Removed IS-specific stopwords: "information", "system", "jats", "research", "paper", etc.
- Cleaned special characters, normalized text

### 2. **TF-IDF Analysis**
- **TfidfVectorizer** with 1-3 word n-grams
- Min document frequency: 5% (must appear in multiple papers)
- Max document frequency: 80% (not too ubiquitous)
- Extracted top distinctive keywords per cluster

### 3. **Citation Integration**
- Combined **OpenAlex citations** (more current) with **CrossRef citations**
- OpenAlex cited_by_count when available, fallback to CrossRef
- Enables accurate impact assessment

### 4. **Theme Generation**
- Top 3-4 TF-IDF keywords form theme name
- Validated against most-cited papers in cluster
- Human-readable, IS-specific descriptions

## Comparison: Before vs After

### OpenAlex Keywords (Generic):
```
Cluster 0: Computer science, Business, Marketing, Paleontology, Biology
```
- ‚ùå Paleontology? Biology? Not IS research!
- ‚ùå Too broad, interdisciplinary noise
- ‚ùå Same keywords across many clusters

### TF-IDF Themes (Meaningful):
```
Cluster 0: Online / Social / Consumers
  Keywords: online (0.112), product (0.077), trust (0.077), reviews (0.074)
  Papers: 1,250 | Mean Citations: 109.5
```
- ‚úÖ Clear IS research theme: E-commerce
- ‚úÖ Distinctive keywords from actual paper content
- ‚úÖ Validated by top papers and citations

## Key Takeaways

1. **OpenAlex keywords are NOT suitable** for detailed IS research stream analysis
   - Too generic (Computer Science, Business, etc.)
   - Include irrelevant domains (Paleontology, Biology)
   - Don't capture IS-specific themes

2. **TF-IDF on titles/abstracts works excellently**
   - Captures actual research themes
   - Distinctive keywords per cluster
   - Validated by highly-cited papers

3. **Citation data integration is critical**
   - OpenAlex has more current citations
   - CrossRef provides historical baseline
   - Combined approach gives best accuracy

4. **Hierarchical clustering reveals structure**
   - 102 clusters across 4 levels
   - Broad themes (Level 0) ‚Üí Specialized topics (Level 3)
   - Meaningful progression from general to specific

5. **Technology Adoption remains highest impact**
   - 313.9 mean citations - 2.5x higher than average
   - Seminal TAM papers drive the field
   - Continues to be foundational IS research

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Academic Publication**
   - Use these themes to structure literature review
   - Citation analysis reveals seminal vs emerging streams
   - Hierarchical structure shows field evolution

2. **Further Analysis**
   - Temporal analysis: How have themes evolved 2016-2025?
   - Journal specialization: Which streams dominate each journal?
   - Author networks: Who are central figures in each stream?

3. **Dashboard Enhancements**
   - Add temporal sliders to see stream evolution
   - Network graphs showing inter-stream citations
   - Export functionality for filtered paper lists

4. **Validation**
   - Expert review of cluster themes
   - Compare with existing IS taxonomies
   - Survey IS researchers on theme accuracy
