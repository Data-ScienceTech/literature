**Title:** Mapping the Information Systems Literature via Hybrid Text–Citation Clustering: A Three-Level Taxonomy of Streams, Topics, and Niches  
**Author & Corresponding:** Carlos Denner dos Santos (carlosdenner@unb.br)

Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript titled above, submitted for consideration at *Information Systems Research (ISR)*.

**What the paper does.** We develop a transparent, minutes-scale pipeline to map the IS field by combining textual semantics (TF–IDF + LSI) with citation structure (bibliographic coupling) into a hybrid embedding, followed by multi-level clustering that yields (L1) streams, (L2) topics, and (L3) niches. We validate clusters with internal metrics and targeted manual checks, and release code, data-processing scripts, and an interactive explorer.

**Contributions.** (1) A reproducible end-to-end method for large-scale literature mapping; (2) a hybrid representation that improves cluster quality versus text-only or citation-only baselines; (3) an empirically grounded three-level taxonomy of the IS literature with actionable uses for scholars and editors.

**Fit to ISR.** ISR values rigorous, analytically grounded contributions to the IS discipline. Our work advances methodological practice for cumulative knowledge synthesis and provides field-level insights relevant to ISR’s readership (positioning of studies, reviewer matching, curriculum design). The artifacts (code, RUNBOOK, explorer) align with open and reproducible research expectations.

**Originality & status.** This manuscript is original, not under review elsewhere, and all authors approve its submission. Data/code availability and disclosures are included in the manuscript and appendices.

We appreciate your consideration and would welcome the opportunity to revise the work in response to reviewer feedback.

Sincerely,
