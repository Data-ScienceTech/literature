jatsp failed or partially failed information systems is investments continue to be a problem in both public and private sectors although there are many causes of such failure lack of clarity about the goals and benefits expected and how they are to be realized is one of the major contributors this is particularly so in the public sector where the purpose of is investment is not to increase profits but to accomplish social and political goals one way of reducing failure and wastage rates is to have exante evaluation over the past three decades is research has proposed a plethora of new theoretical approaches to improving exante evaluation but with a few exceptions these have had little impact on practice this paper presents a way to address this gap between theory and practice it proposes a way in which managers can improve is investment evaluation by changing perspective from a focus on traditional analytic tools towards a design attitude that seeks to develop multicriteria is evaluation approach based on contextual experience and prior knowledge the proposed approach enables organizations to design and develop a value case using value dials as a common language that defines what constitutes the value of particular is investments for a specific context to assess its effectiveness this approach was applied using a multilevel dialogical action research project within a swedish public organization the findings show that managers in this organization significantly improved the effectiveness of their evaluation of is investments jatsp,Evaluation of Information System Investments: A Value Dials approach to closing the theory-practice gap,Journal of Information Technology,2015.0,10.1057/jit.2014.9,"['https://openalex.org/W1480301668' 'https://openalex.org/W1492651720'

jatsp we investigate whether the discounts offered by online daily deals help attract consumer purchases by tracking the sales of 19978 deals on grouponcom and conducting a battery of identification and falsification tests we find that deep discounts reduce sales a 1 increase in a deal’s discount decreases sales by 0035–0256 if a merchant offers an additional 10 discount from the sample mean of 556 sales could decrease by 063–460 or 080–524 units and 42–275 in revenue this negative effect of discount is more prominent among credence goods and deals with low sales and when the deals are offered in cities with higher income and better education our findings suggest that consumers are concerned about product quality and excessive discounts may reduce sales immediately a followup lab experiment provides further support to this qualityconcern explanation furthermore it suggests the existence of a “threshold” effect the negative effect on sales is present only when the discount is sufficiently high additional empirical analysis shows that deals displaying favorable thirdparty support such as facebook fans and online reviews are more susceptible to this adverse discount effect we draw related managerial implications jatspjatsp the online appendix is available at httpsdoiorg101287isre20170772  jatsp,When Discounts Hurt Sales: The Case of Daily-Deal Markets,Information Systems Research,2018.0,10.1287/isre.2017.0772,"['https://openalex.org/W1480376833' 'https://openalex.org/W1489741075'

jatsp which service occupations are the most susceptible to global disaggregation what are the factors and mechanisms that make service occupations amenable to global disaggregation this research addresses these questions by building on previous work by apte and mason 1995 and rai et al 2006 that focuses on the unbundling of information and physical flows we propose a theory of service disaggregation and argue that high information intensity makes an occupation more amenable to disaggregation because the activities in such occupations can be codified standardized and modularized we empirically validate our theoretical model using data on more than 300 service occupations we find that at the mean skill level the information intensity of an occupation is positively associated with the disaggregation potential of that occupation and the effect of information intensity on disaggregation potential is mediated by the modularizability of an occupation we also find that skills moderate the effect of information intensity on service disaggregation jatspjatsp furthermore we study the patterns in us employment and salary growth from 2000 to 2004 contrary to popular perception we do not find any adverse effect in terms of employment growth or salary growth for high informationintensity occupations at the mean skill level our findings show that highskill occupations have experienced higher employment and salary growth than lowskill occupations at the mean level of information intensity notably high informationintensity occupations that require higher skill levels have experienced higher employment growth though this employment growth is accompanied by a decline in salary growth occupations with a higher need for physical presence have also experienced higher employment growth and lower salary growth overall these results imply that firms and managers need to consider the modularizability of occupations as they reallocate global resources to pursue cost and innovation opportunities for individual workers our results highlight the importance of continuous investments in human capital and skill acquisition because high informationintensity and highskill occupations appear to be relatively less vulnerable to global disaggregation jatsp,"Is the World Flat or Spiky?

jatspresearchers and practitioners are increasingly interested in understanding how organizations transform their value propositions and practices using digital technologies while the extant literature offers important empirical and theoretical insights into digital transformation in individual organizations we know little about how adopting organizations within an organizational field react differently over time to the same digital transformation initiative this is unfortunate as such insights could help scholars and managers understand option repertoires and constraints in handling digital transformation ideas that travel into organizations against this backdrop we had access to a unique case over an eighteenyear period which shows how organizations within the danish home care field reacted differently to a nationwide digital transformation initiative on mobile technology use to analyze this case we applied virus theory as a promising perspective for examining how and why the same digital technology and transformation idea occasions different reactions in similar contexts our analysis highlights the emerging fluctuating and consequential nature of digital transformation within the danish home care field which has led to very different reactions across adopting organizations drawing on this analysis we contribute to the expanding literature on digital transformation by providing theoretical and practical knowledge about variations regarding how organizations within an organizational field react over time to digital transformation ideasjatsp,Same but Different: Variations in Reactions to Digital Transformation Within an Organizational Field,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2023.0,10.17705/1jais.00770,"['https://openalex.org/W1543336469' 'https://openalex.org/W1556808170'

jatsp this paper investigates the ramifications of information feed integration on user engagements and contributions in online contentsharing platforms by exploiting a natural experiment occurred in a leading knowledgesharing platform that integrated informal social posts with professional knowledge content in one feed our results show that the juxtaposition of incongruous types of content increased mindset switching and cognitive strain thus hurting user engagements we also reveal a novel crowdingout effect viz the integration heightened concerns that posting informal social posts would dilute the contributor’s professional image thus inhibiting user contributions our findings hold important practical implications for all platforms that host or are considering hosting diverse types of usergenerated content ugc additional content curation tools can potentially enhance user engagement and retention but their effectiveness hinges on a foundational and crucial element—the presentation format of heterogeneous content types essentially the value of curating informal social posts in a knowledgesharing platform would diminish when those content intrudes upon and conflict with the professional domain this insight underscores that any ugc platforms when adopting a diversityoriented strategy should pay close attention to heterogeneity between different content types for the purpose of optimizing user experiences and promoting user contributions jatsp,Consequences of Information Feed Integration on User Engagement and Contribution: A Natural Experiment in an Online Knowledge-Sharing Community,Information Systems Research,2024.0,10.1287/isre.2022.0043,"['https://openalex.org/W1246328688' 'https://openalex.org/W1965602425'

new forms of implicit consumer collaborations in online communities and social networks influence demand preferences as consumers themselves increasingly participate in creating cultural products that both complements and competes with firm offerings although research findings on these issues vary strong evidence from both theoretical and empirical work suggests that the increased technology affordance on the consumer side challenges the profitability of conventional producer strategies that are based on pushing product designs that serve large segments of consumers while ignoring the service of more nuanced consumer preferences in this study we present a market design in which producers create and sell original digital culture product and examine the effect of consumer cocreation in the presence of consumer sharing piracy on market performance in terms of consumer and producer surplus and consumer choice using the methods of experimental economics we find strong interaction effects between consumer sharing and cocreation and more specifically we find that consumer sharing interacts with consumerbased cocreation and increases product variety and consumer surplus while reducing producer benefits from cocreation,Consumer Co-creation of Digital Culture Products: Business Threat or New Opportunity?,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2015.0,10.17705/1jais.00409,"['https://openalex.org/W115993810' 'https://openalex.org/W1479993346'

jatstitleabstractjatstitlejatspmost of the service innovation in e‐government initiatives has been initially focused on making a digital version of an equivalent physical service followed by creating new services through either adopting new business models or overhauling existing infrastructures the former approach uses variants of e‐commerce business models to drive service innovation whereas the latter entails changes to the backend for driving system efficiency and integration which later serve for reorganising and improving service provision each approach presents a different way of assembling services infrastructures people and business models the ramifications of each assemblage to service innovation are less understood this paper seeks to examine the intended and unintended consequences of these two contrasting approaches inductively and deductively our findings show that a frontend approach enables quick improvements and enacts a variety of structures with each structure inscribing a set of new path‐dependent routines in the infrastructures in the backend approach it took longer to introduce new services yet the services were of a higher quality and required less modification in the long run quantitative analyses confirmed these findings we attributed the alignment advantage of backend approach to better interdepartmental collaboration organised around a technology platform for system and service integration concentrating resources on a coherent rather than a diverse set of business models this approach realigns practices and routines and technology internally whereas the explorative diverse use of business models in the frontend approach for service innovation is less sustainablejatsp,Assembling infrastructures and business models for service design and innovation,Information Systems Journal,2013.0,10.1111/j.1365-2575.2012.00418.x,"['https://openalex.org/W169241035' 'https://openalex.org/W1715153959'

jatsp extant research considers the it governance choice to be a tradeoff between the costefficiency of centralization and the responsiveness provided by local information processing this view predicts that firms tend to decentralize it governance in more uncertain environments we investigate this issue by studying the relationship between environmental uncertainty and it infrastructure governance in a sample of business units from fortune 1000 companies the key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in it infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship that is when environmental uncertainty increases from low to high firms tend to first decentralize their it infrastructure decisions to the business units to enhance their responsiveness and then centralize their it infrastructure decisions to the headquarters as uncertainty increases further to achieve the benefits of coordination and to mitigate the potential agency problem in uncertain environments moreover the study proposes that business unrelatedness between business units and their headquarters moderates the curvilinear relationship between environmental uncertainty and it infrastructure governance we find that both the propositions are supported by the data jatsp,Environmental Uncertainty and IT Infrastructure Governance: A Curvilinear Relationship,Information Systems Research,2011.0,10.1287/isre.1090.0269,"['https://openalex.org/W127844095' 'https://openalex.org/W1485916023'

economic social and political institutions worldwide are relying increasingly on communication technology to perform a variety of functions holding electronic town meetings where hundreds of people in numerous cities participate simultaneously forging strategic links with business partners thereby forming virtual corporations that can be instantly disbanded redefining the conventional notion of a college campus by offering classes via interactive media to nontraditional students and enabling consumers with personal digital assistants to remain connected with their children and families at all times in this environment where geographic and temporal boundaries are shrinking rapidly electronic meeting systems ems are playing an important role this study examines the impact of teams on using ems in dispersed and facetoface settings the results suggest that ems can be effective in augmenting traditional audioconferencing by strengthening the medium and allowing additional communication use to be exchanged among participants they also indicate that ems can improve decisionmaking performance given proper tasktechnology fit and adequate facilitation as businesses expand globally such systems will provide instant communication capabilities and help coordinate dispersed decisionmaking activities,Impact of Communication Medium and Computer Support on Group Perceptions and Performance: A Comparison of Face-to-Face and Dispersed Meetings,MIS Quarterly,1993.0,10.2307/249588,"['https://openalex.org/W1489939810' 'https://openalex.org/W1505856424'

jatsp there is a plethora of theories to explore the disciplines of business management and sociology with institutional theory being widely used to explore a range of research challenges in the area of information systems is the use of institutional theory remains in its infancy with much potential for adoption much of the rationale underpinning the proposed research is that a systematic review and synthesis of the normative literature may support the direction of further research and the use of institutional theory in exploring pertinent research challenges facing the is community this study also serves to signpost crossdisciplinary research and thus opens up a whole new research paradigm therefore this article seeks to provide a bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to institutional theory to ascertain the current ‘state of play’ of the theory information on a series of variables was extracted after conducting a review of 511 articles across various disciplines that have utilised institutional theory published in 210 peerreviewed journals between 1978 and 2008 the findings suggest that the positivist paradigm empirical and quantitative research the survey method and organisationfirm as a unit of analysis was used predominantly in combination with institutional theory the results of this study may have implications for researchers journal editors reviewers and universities jatsp,The Diffusion and Use of Institutional Theory: A Cross-Disciplinary Longitudinal Literature Survey,Journal of Information Technology,2009.0,10.1057/jit.2009.16,"['https://openalex.org/W1487101402' 'https://openalex.org/W1529670513'

jatspseizing the latest technological advances in distributed work an increasing number of firms have set up offshore captive centers ccs in emerging economies to carry out sophisticated rampd work we analyze survey data from 132 rampd ccs established by foreign multinational companies in india to understand how firms execute distributed innovative work specifically we examine the performance outcomes of projects using different technologyenabled coordination strategies to manage their interdependencies across multiple locations we find that modularization of work across locations is largely ineffective when the underlying tasks are less routinized less analyzable and less familiar to the cc coordination based on information sharing across locations is effective when the cc performs tasks that are less familiar to it a key contribution of our work is the explication of the task contingencies under which coordination based on modularization versus information sharing yield differential performance outcomesjatsp,"Efficacy of R&amp;D Work in Offshore Captive Centers: An Empirical Study of Task Characteristics, Coordination Mechanisms, and Performance",Information Systems Research,2014.0,10.1287/isre.2014.0552,"['https://openalex.org/W10259981' 'https://openalex.org/W1424744123'

jatspmany twosided platforms such as ebay ios android and twitter invest in developer integration tools such as modular interfaces interactive development environments application programming interfaces and help desks in order to reduce the cost and improve the functionality of thirdparty content developed for the platform although these integration tools are crucial to platform success they are costly to create and therefore managers need to understand where and when to deploy them in particular when the necessary integration investment is high the advice to subsidize one side of a twosided market while charging the other may not hold this means that integration investment should be carefully coordinated with market pricing decisions in general higher levels of investment by hardwaresoftware platforms into integration become desirable when the platform 1 has access to a large pool of content providers and consumers 2 is able to develop integration tools that are highly effective in reducing thirdparty development costs and 3 operates in highconsumer value markets however there are nuances for example business to business platforms can make investments in integration to facilitate participation by both sides of the market we find that such investments are complements not—as one might expect—substitutesjatsp,Platform Pricing and Investment to Drive Third-Party Value Creation in Two-Sided Networks,Information Systems Research,2020.0,10.1287/isre.2019.0882,"['https://openalex.org/W1540343830' 'https://openalex.org/W1552499017'

despite the potential of health information technology hit systems to significantly reduce medical errors streamline clinical processes contain healthcare costs and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare their adoption by hospitals in the united states has been rather slow to study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer we propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting hit adoption we also propose that in a network setting the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteenyear horizon we find strong support for our hypotheses our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years therefore recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate hit adoption,Healthcare IT Adoption: An Analysis of Knowledge Transfer in Socioeconomic Networks,Journal of Management Information Systems,2014.0,10.1080/07421222.2014.994672,"['https://openalex.org/W141428010' 'https://openalex.org/W1494802451'

jatsp in this paper we study the impact of increases in media coverage from two sources newspapers and blogs on firm founding rates in the context of technologybased entrepreneurship although increasing work in information systems is has begun to investigate the effect of usergenerated content on entrepreneurial behavior limited attention has been devoted to how media affects firm founding or the boundary conditions of such an effect arguing for the direct effect of increased discourse in traditional and usergenerated media in the information technology it industry results suggest that discourse in traditional media and blogs strongly influences it firm founding rates we further consider the differential impacts of media discourse on firm founding in different it subsectors over time and in different locations we test our hypotheses using entrepreneurial firm founding data from venturexpert from 1998 to 2007 social media data from the three largest blogging platforms and traditional media coverage from 11 major us newspapers our work contributes to a better understanding of the concurrent effects of multiple forms of media on decision making and adds to the small but emerging literature addressing entrepreneurshiprelated research questions in is jatsp,"Research Note—Tigerblood: Newspapers, Blogs, and the Founding of Information Technology Firms",Information Systems Research,2015.0,10.1287/isre.2015.0603,"['https://openalex.org/W1481908410' 'https://openalex.org/W1516319550'

new software product development entails considerable risks one significant risk is that decision makers can become overly committed to troubled software product development projects ie escalation of commitment while prior research has identified factors that promote escalation in information technology projects there has been little attempt to leverage the context of software product development which can include evaluating attributes of a software product under development and weighing a personal financial reward tied to a successful product launch in this study we conducted two experiments to investigate how evaluability bias concerning software attributes and the fairness effect that arises from the relative amount of a personal financial reward influence the escalation of commitment to troubled software product development projects our findings suggest that the escalation of commitment to troubled software product development projects is influenced by both evaluability bias which affects the perceived attractiveness of a software product under development and the fairness effect which influences the perceived attractiveness of a personal financial reward tied to a successful product launch this study contributes to both the information systems literature and the escalation literature by providing novel theoretical explanations as to why escalation occurs in the context of new software product development,The Role of Evaluability Bias and the Fairness Effect in the Escalation of Commitment to Troubled Software ProductDevelopment Projects,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2019.0,10.17705/1jais.00585,"['https://openalex.org/W1483047065' 'https://openalex.org/W1492503486'

jatsp in modern enterprise computing environments multiple information technology it services from first and third parties are often integrated to form coherent solutions for enterprise customers in this study we seek to understand how uncertainties introduced by thirdparty services shape enterprise customers’ use of various it services in these multivendor service settings specifically we analyze a case of disruption caused by a third party that affects the multivendor service but does not directly affect the firstparty services we find a temporary increase in the use of firstparty services that serve as similargoal substitutes during the disruption however there is a net decline in the total use of services in the long run to assess what actions the first party can take during such disruptions to turn the challenge into an opportunity we analyze the first party’s technical support log using deep learning techniques we find that if the first party offers highquality technical support that addresses productrelated issues it may be able to make lemonade out of lemons such technical support effectively boosts customers’ use of firstparty services in the long run curiously however similar efforts by the first party in the predisruption period are ineffective in achieving the same effect jatsp,Making Lemonade from Lemons: A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective on Third-Party Disruptions in a Multivendor Information Technology Service,Information Systems Research,2025.0,10.1287/isre.2022.0033,"['https://openalex.org/W1489913852' 'https://openalex.org/W1492892277'

jatsp the practice of using a “second screen” while concurrently watching television tv has become a widespread phenomenon people use a smartphone a tablet or a laptop while watching tv to conduct research on the show that they are watching to communicate with their friends or to do online shopping whereas work on multitasking suggests that tv consumption may lead to lower online sales research in the area of impulse buying suggests the opposite our finding based on a panel data set following 100000 consumers in the united states and a big data set from browsing behavior shows on the aggregate and the individual level that second screening can lead to higher sales for lowcomplexity goods eg beverages food detergents but causes lower sales of highly complex goods like financial products and consumer electronics if a tv program appeals to a large tv audience then this results in fewer immediate sales of highcomplexity products 1 increase in tv consumption leads to −22 sales and more sales of lowcomplexity products 1 increase in tv consumption leads to 88 sales jatsp,Second Screening—The Influence of Concurrent TV Consumption on Online Shopping Behavior,Information Systems Research,2022.0,10.1287/isre.2021.1099,"['https://openalex.org/W1528134887' 'https://openalex.org/W1974732675'

jatsp in this study we model firms that sell a product and a complementary online service where only the latter displays positive network effects that is the value each consumer derives from the service increases with the total number of consumers that subscribe to the service in addition the service is valuable only to consumers who buy the product we consider two pricing strategies 1 bundle pricing in which the firm charges a single price for the product and the service and 2 separate pricing in which the firm sets the prices of the product and the service separately and consumers selfselect whether to buy both or only the product we show that in contrast to the common result in the bundling literature often the monopolist chooses not to offer the bundle he either sells the service separately or not at all although bundling would increase both consumer surplus and social welfare thus underprovision of the service can be the market outcome we also demonstrate that network effects may cause the underprovision of the service jatsp,<b>Research Note</b>— Analyzing Pricing Strategies for Online Services with Network Effects,Information Systems Research,2012.0,10.1287/isre.1110.0414,"['https://openalex.org/W1598833883' 'https://openalex.org/W1976761884'

traditionally information security has been approached in terms of how to achieve the confidentiality integrity and availability of information in this paper we seek to ontologically examine information security by using gilles deleuze and félix guattaris philosophical concepts of machine coupling interruption and territory through these concepts we conceptualize information security as an orderseeking connectionbased territorial security machine that attempts to subject and harness other actors – from technical devices and physical barriers to employees and various combinations of these actors – to carry out the security machines protective tasks the goal of the security machine is to block or interrupt the chaotic forces of the outside and thus to maintain the fragile order of information however the process of interrupting the outside requires interruption of the inside as well users and organizations are interrupted daily by the security machine and its practices yet this aspect of information security has remained largely unexamined we argue that the question of what information security does to its subjects – what its effects are – in the protected system should be examined more thoroughly,The Order Machine – The Ontology of Information Security,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2012.0,10.17705/1jais.00306,"['https://openalex.org/W101424076' 'https://openalex.org/W1501108475'

online discussion groups have become an increasingly popular way to create social networks where individuals congregate electronically to share advice and ideas in order to better understand sustainability we propose that research needs to go beyond examining quantitative changes in the structural dynamics of online discussion groups such as membership size and message volume and include investigation of the social dynamics characterizing the underlying qualities of the interactions among members we take a mixedmethods approach to provide qualitative and empirical support for our theory by investigating the dynamics of one successful online discussion group over a fiveyear period our data set includes all 150267 messages posted to 27743 threads by 9042 unique individuals over a five year period in a group that is focused on sharing advice about a medical topic back pain we find support for our hypotheses that 1 shifts in the structural and social dynamics underlying resource availability lead to changes in communication activities but in unexpected ways fewer members contributed significantly more message volume in turn 2 shifts in the structural and social dynamics underlying communication activities lead to changes in coping strategies as message volume increased and became more social members increased their efforts and were less likely to defect finally 3 shifts in the structural and social dynamics underlying coping strategies lead to changes in attraction and retention as individual efforts increased more individuals were retained however fewer new members were attracted to join the group our main thesis is that each online discussion group is a product of its structural and social dynamics in combination and the influence of these factors on sustainability is best understood when they are examined in relation to each other over time,Online discussion group sustainability: Investigating the interplay between structural dynamics and social dynamics over time,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2010.0,10.17705/1jais.00220,"['https://openalex.org/W113869976' 'https://openalex.org/W1150612697'

jatsp in this paper we investigate whether social support exchanged in an online healthcare community benefits patients’ mental health we propose a nonhomogeneous partially observed markov decision process pomdp model to examine the latent health outcomes for online health community members the transition between different health states is modeled as a probability function that incorporates different forms of social support that patients exchange via discussion board posts we find that patients benefit from learning from others and that their participation in the online community helps them to improve their health and to better engage in their disease selfmanagement process our results also reveal differences in the influence of various forms of social support exchanged on the evolution of patients’ health conditions we find evidence that informational support is the most prevalent type in the online healthcare community nevertheless emotional support plays the most significant role in helping patients move to a healthier state overall the influence of social support is found to vary depending on patients’ health conditions finally we demonstrate that our proposed pomdp model can provide accurate predictions for patients’ health states and can be used to recover missing or unavailable information on patients’ health conditions jatsp,Feeling Blue?

jatsp early studies on web design typically caution against the use of distracting website features in electronic commerce such as animated banners popups and floating advertisements because they may cause annoyance for online consumers and disrupt information processing leading to poorer purchase decisions yet the recently uncovered deliberationwithoutattention dwa effect suggests that distracting consumers from the decisionmaking process may improve their decision quality when there are a large number of decision parameters to consider to ascertain whether the dwa effect can be triggered through the use of distracting website features in the context of online shopping two experiments are conducted the first experiment reveals that the presence of distracting website features in the form of popups gives rise to annoyance in general but also leads to better purchase decisions when the decision to be made is complex the second experiment supports the findings of the first and sheds further light on the underlying mode of thought triggered by these features in particular by eliminating a number of potential alternative mechanisms including online judgments the mere disruption of decisionrelated thought and cognitively constrained conscious deliberation the second experiment demonstrates that unconscious deliberation is likely to be the underlying cause of superior decision making with these findings this research supports a more balanced view in the recent human–computer interaction literature which suggests that the usual advice to minimize the use of distracting website features should be examined more carefully the research also uncovers evidence that contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding the dwa effect and unconscious thought theory jatsp,Research Note—Deliberation Without Attention: The Latent Benefits of Distracting Website Features for Online Purchase Decisions,Information Systems Research,2015.0,10.1287/isre.2015.0566,"['https://openalex.org/W102137881' 'https://openalex.org/W131148576'

this paper demonstrates that qualitycontingent pricing is a useful mechanism for mitigating the negative effects of quality uncertainty in ecommerce and information technology services under contingency pricing of an information good or service the firm preannounces a rebate for poor performance consumers determine performance probabilities using publicly available historical performance data and the firm may have additional private information with respect to its future probability distribution examining the monopoly case we explicate the critical role of private information and differences in belief between the firm and market in the choice of pricing scheme contingent pricing is useful when the market underestimates the firms performance then it is optimal for the firm to offer a fullprice rebate for misperformance with a correspondingly higher price for meeting the performance standard we study the competitive value of contingency pricing in a duopoly setting where the firms differ in their probabilities of meeting the performance standard but are identical in other respects contingency pricing is a dominant strategy for a firm when the market underestimates the firms performance whereas both firms would earn equal profits if they were constrained to standard pricing the superior firm earns greater profits under contingency pricing by setting lower expected prices we show that contingency pricing is efficient as well and consumer surplus increases because more consumers buy from the superior firm,Contingency Pricing for Information Goods and Services Under Industrywide Performance Standard,Journal of Management Information Systems,2003.0,10.1080/07421222.2003.11045766,"['https://openalex.org/W151462478' 'https://openalex.org/W1551781594'

we use a gametheoretic model to examine how information personalization by firms interacts with different dimensions of product differentiation namely horizontal and vertical differentiation we consider the possibility that consumers attach different importance to various types of product differentiation and report the equilibrium in terms of the quality—fit ratio which measures the relative strength of preference for quality compared to preference for product fit and is a function of the cost of quality and the cost of product misfit we also consider how different market structures whether firms are similar or differentiated on the horizontal dimension ex ante lead to different equilibriums when firms adopt personalization we show that personalization by one firm leads to higher profits for both firms if product quality and misfit costs are high and the firms offer similar products ex ante on the other hand if firms offer differentiated products personalization is profitable only if the effectiveness of the personalization technology is high or if both product quality and misfit costs are low we also highlight conditions under which investments in personalization and product quality can be complements or substitutes to each other finally we show that a firm can respond to a competitors personalization by either increasing aggressive response or decreasing defensive response investments in its own quality our results provide insights to managers on when to invest in personalization technologies and how to adjust their investments in product quality after the firm or its competitor adopts personalization,Information Personalization in a Two-Dimensional Product Differentiation Model,Journal of Management Information Systems,2009.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222260204,"['https://openalex.org/W1524636595' 'https://openalex.org/W1552238403'

jatspdrawing on construal level theory prior literature has found a positivity bias in online ratings when consumers evaluate an experience from a psychological distance whether spatial or temporal selfdistancing theory posits that psychological distance enables individuals to reflect on psychologically distant negative experiences more genuinely in a less biased way this raises the question of whether the positivity bias in ratings due to psychological distance persists for negative experiences to address this question we collected data from a large review platform that enables the identification of reviewers’ spatial and temporal distance the negativity of an experience was operationalized via review text sentiment we introduced spatial and temporal distance as moderators between sentiment negativity and ratings and found a negative moderation by spatial distance and a positive moderation by temporal distance our findings indicate that the relationship between sentiment negativity and rating grows stronger under spatial distance and gets weaker under temporal distance text mining confirmed selfdistancing as the driver behind the spatial moderation and construal levels as the driver behind the temporal moderation we attribute the asymmetric moderations to differences in the tangibility of spatial distance more tangible and temporal distance less tangible these results improve our understanding of reviewing behavior and can help platforms debias ratingsjatsp,Reviewing from a Distance: Uncovering Asymmetric Moderations of Spatial and Temporal Distance between Sentiment Negativity and Rating,MIS Quarterly,2023.0,10.25300/misq/2022/17037,"['https://openalex.org/W1522263329' 'https://openalex.org/W1719871446'

this study examines overconfidence in phishing email detection researchers believe that overconfidence ie where ones judgmental confidence exceeds ones actual performance in decision making can lead to ones adopting risky behavior in uncertain situations this study focuses on what leads to overconfidence in phishing detection we performed a survey experiment with 600 subjects to collect empirical data for the study in the experiment each subject judged a set of randomly selected phishing emails and authentic business emails specifically we examined two metrics of overconfidence ie overprecision and overestimation results show that cognitive effort decreased overconfidence while variability in attention allocation dispositional optimism and familiarity with the business entities in the emails all increased overconfidence in phishing email detection the effect of perceived selfefficacy of detecting phishing emails on overconfidence was marginal in addition all confidence beliefs poorly predicted detection accuracy and poorly explained its variance which highlights the issue of relying on them to guide ones behavior in detecting phishing we discuss mechanisms to reduce overconfidence,Overconfidence in Phishing Email Detection,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2016.0,10.17705/1jais.00442,"['https://openalex.org/W1489771250' 'https://openalex.org/W1493550615'

information technology it radically alters the cost of capturing storing and analyzing information and thus dramatically alters the value of the historical data represented by a firms detailed transaction records of customer interactions yet information systems are seldom used to their full potential in developing flexible pricing strategies and tailored offerings for individual customers based either on the actual cost of serving these customers or on their demonstrated preferences and requirements this will become increasingly crucial in industries with heterogeneous customers and with costs that vary widely across customers in order to enable flexible pricing and to provide services that are accurately targeted at the needs of specific customer segments in addition accurate detailed and robust costaccounting systems and expertise in the interpretation of performance data will increasingly become essential for competing successfully those firms prevented from accurate microsegmentation by corporate culture and tradition by regulation or by an outmoded information infrastructure will be vulnerable to newer and more nimble competitors in particular being the lowcost provider with economies of scale will not provide adequate defense against targeted creamskimming by opportunistic competitors able to offer lower prices to selected customer segments the earliest academic papers on the strategic implications of information technology explicitly adopted a framework recommending that firms adopt a single simple generic strategy from a small set cost leadership differentiation or niche in contrast recent experience suggests that it may enable firms to select from more finely tuned strategic options and that it may require them to implement mulliple strategies simultaneously,"Segmentation, Differentiation, and Flexible Pricing: Experiences with Information Technology and Segment-Tailored Strategies",Journal of Management Information Systems,1994.0,10.1080/07421222.1994.11518038,"['https://openalex.org/W137132437' 'https://openalex.org/W1486636806'

changes in the knowledge and skill requirements of information systems is positions were examined by analyzing the content of advertisements for is professionals placed in four major newspapers over the 20year period 19701990 three types of jobs were examined programmers systems analysts and is managers the analysis of the frequency of phrases in these advertisements suggests that job ads for programmers have changed very little  technical requirements remain high and business and systems knowledge requirements remain relatively low although the frequency of mention of business requirements has increased somewhat is management positions are also relatively stable as relected in the makeup of job ads from the standpoint that business knowledge requirements have remained high with technical and systems requirements specified less frequently the greatest transition in specified job requirements over this 20year period has occurred for systems analysts although this is perhaps not surprising the nature of this transition is contrary to expectations the relative frequency and proportion of stated technical knowledge requirements in ads have increased dramatically while the relative frequency of business and systems knowledge requirements has actually decreased slightlythese results raise questions concerning the implicit understanding by academics and practioners alike of the need for business knowledge on the part of systems analysts and other is professionals various interpretations of these findings are provided and the implications for both education and recruitment are discussed,The Evolution of IS Job Skills: A Content Analysis of IS Job Advertisements from 1970 to 1990,MIS Quarterly,1995.0,10.2307/249709,"['https://openalex.org/W119429875' 'https://openalex.org/W1482419128'

jatspuser privacy protection is a vital issue of concern for online social networks osns even though users often intentionally hide their private information in osns since adversaries may conduct prediction attacks to predict hidden information using advanced machine learning techniques private information that users intend to hide may still be at risk of being exposed taking the current city listed on facebook profiles as a case we propose a solution that estimates and manages the exposure risk of users’ hidden information first we simulate an aggressive prediction attack using advanced stateoftheart machine learning algorithms by proposing a new current city prediction framework that integrates location indications based on various types of information exposed by users including demographic attributes behaviors and relationships second we study prediction attack results to model patterns of prediction correctness as correct predictions lead to information exposures and construct an exposure risk estimator the proposed exposure risk estimator has the ability not only to notify users of exposure risks related to their hidden current city but can also help users mitigate exposure risks by overhauling and selecting countermeasures moreover our exposure risk estimator can improve the privacy management of osns by facilitating empirical studies on the exposure risks of osn users as a group taking the current city as a case this work offers insight on how to protect other types of private information against machinelearning prediction attacks and reveals several important implications for both practice management and future researchjatsp,Is Hidden Safe?

jatsp auditing has been commonly used in major industries including healthcare to curb fraudulent activity in addition to the direct benefits of auditing data collected in this study through interviews a focus group and surveys of medical practitioners and audit experts indicate that auditing has a secondorder effect through which audit information diffuses in the practitioner network triggering deterrence this secondorder effect referred to as the “sentinel effect” has been overlooked by auditing algorithms that have traditionally focused on detection of fraudulent claims or practitioners only the authors present an algorithm that supports a deterrencedriven audit approach in the presence of audit and sentinel effects simulation results augmented with real practitioner data from two counties in florida indicate the potential of such algorithms at reducing excess costs especially when waste and abuse are prevalent management insight savings from audit arise as a result of both the direct audit effect and the sentinel effect which causes deterrence among people who might hear about audits insurance providers could therefore consider connectedness conditional on high enough risk scores when selecting practitioners for audit through the sentinel effect large numbers of practitioners receiving the audit information are likely to improve billing behavior ultimately maximizing deterrence from waste and abuse and reducing overall healthcare costs jatsp,Audit Policies Under the Sentinel Effect: Deterrence-Driven Algorithms,Information Systems Research,2019.0,10.1287/isre.2019.0841,"['https://openalex.org/W1485623843' 'https://openalex.org/W1501241011'

jatspcrowdfunding has reached enormous popularity among entrepreneurs yet many struggle to fund their projects for example only 398 of all kickstarter projects get funded why entrepreneurs need to set a predefined funding goal which needs to be reached to get the project funded if not reached they do not get the money to reach the funding goal entrepreneurs can design reward menus from which backers can choose lowpriced to highpriced rewards to support a given project we show that simply inserting a socalled decoy option—an option in the first place that does not make sense but makes higherpriced options more attractive—can lead to significantly more backers choosing a highpriced option up to 28 more highpriced choices this makes it more likely for entrepreneurs to reach their predefined funding goals and thus start their designated projectsjatsp,The Attraction Effect in Crowdfunding,Information Systems Research,2023.0,10.1287/isre.2022.1152,"['https://openalex.org/W1919419009' 'https://openalex.org/W1993938397'

during the past two decades both business managers and academic researchers have shown considerable interest in understanding how information technologies it help to create competitive advantage for a firm while recently the idea of competitive differentiation through it has been challenged this study contrasts the traditional thinking about competitive advantage with the resourcebased view specifically it is argued that by demarcating specific types of capabilities we can contribute to better understanding of the sources of itbased competitive advantage conceptually we distinguish here between value competitive and dynamic capabilities as three distinct types of capabilities within each type we identify specific capabilities such as quality of the it infrastructure it business experience relationship infrastructure and intensity of organizational learning and present a model that describes relationships between these capabilities and competitive advantage we then empirically test the model using data collected via a national mail survey from chief it executives from 202 manufacturing firms while the quality of the it infrastructure is hypothesized as a value capability and expectedly did not have any significant effect on competitive advantage the quality of it business expertise and the relationship infrastructure competitive capabilities did the results of the study also indicate that the intensity of organizational learning dynamic capability was significantly related to all of the capabilities these results point to the importance of delineating capabilities such as relationship infrastructure that can facilitate differentiation in the marketplace and dynamic capabilities such as organizational learning as an important antecedent to it capability building,Types of Information Technology Capabilities and Their Role in Competitive Advantage: An Empirical Study,Journal of Management Information Systems,2005.0,10.1080/07421222.2005.11045844,"['https://openalex.org/W1004584821' 'https://openalex.org/W127844095'

jatspwhat differentiates successful from unsuccessful open source software projects this paper develops and tests a model of the impacts of license restrictiveness and organizational sponsorship on two indicators of success user interest in and development activity on open source software development projects using data gathered from freshmeatnet and project home pages the main conclusions derived from the analysis are that 1 license restrictiveness and organizational sponsorship interact to influence user perceptions of the likely utility of open source software in such a way that users are most attracted to projects that are sponsored by nonmarket organizations and that employ nonrestrictive licenses and 2 licensing and sponsorship address complementary developer motivations such that the influence of licensing on development activity depends on what kind of organizational sponsor a project has theoretical and practical implications are discussed and the paper outlines several avenues for future researchjatsp,Impacts of License Choice and Organizational Sponsorship on User Interest and Development Activity in Open Source Software Projects,Information Systems Research,2006.0,10.1287/isre.1060.0082,"['https://openalex.org/W129305155' 'https://openalex.org/W1505316740'

the lack of theories and methodological weakness have been pointed out as two distinct but related problems in empirical management information systems mis research reinforcing the existing belief that too much attention has been devoted to what as opposed to why or when relationships exist this paper focuses on a subset of model building and methodology issues involving the systematic discovery and representation of causal relationships our analysis of the existing empirical mis literature reveals the need to build richer causal models to increase the flexibility of model representation to integrate the isolated worlds of pure latent and pure manifested variables and to provide a tighter linkage between the exploratory and confirmatory research phasesbased on philosophy of science and advances in the fields of experimental economics and sociology we propose a foundation for developing richer models by explicitly considering the exogeneity and endogeneity of constructs and a manipulative account of causality and by recognizing the role of incentives agent and organizational characteristics in mis models since richer models require more flexible tools and techniques the paper describes the representational shortcomings and statistical pitfalls of factoranalytic methods commonly deployed in empirical research we suggest that weak exploratory phase tools and approaches may allow violations of causal assumptions to pass undetected to the confirmatory phase since confirmatory tools like lisrel also make factoranalytic assumptions these violations are not likely to be detected at the confirmatory phase either we propose using tetrad a nonparametric tool at the exploratory phase for its ability to accommodate a wide variety of causal models our findings are summarized within an integrated framework which enhances the likelihood of discovering relationships through richer theoretical support and powerful exploratory analysis,Discovery and Representation of Causal Relationships in MIS Research: A Methodological Framework,MIS Quarterly,1997.0,10.2307/249744,"['https://openalex.org/W1515402129' 'https://openalex.org/W1522229328'

jatsp evidence suggests that consumers often hesitate to transact with webbased vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal information stolen by hackers trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information making purchases and acting on web vendor advice—behaviors essential to widespread adoption of ecommerce therefore trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners prior research on ecommerce trust has used diverse incomplete and inconsistent definitions of trust making it difficult to compare results across studies this paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary multidimensional model of trust in ecommerce the model includes four highlevel constructs—disposition to trust institutionbased trust trusting beliefs and trusting intentions—which are further delineated into 16 measurable literaturegrounded subconstructs the psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical legal advice web site the results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested for internal nomological validity as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other ecommerce constructs for external nomological validity as web experience personal innovativeness and web site quality suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are discussed jatsp,Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce: An Integrative Typology,Information Systems Research,2002.0,10.1287/isre.13.3.334.81,"['https://openalex.org/W100592892' 'https://openalex.org/W133856099'

this study explores the process by which trust evolves over time there have been a number of studies underscoring the importance of trust in the online environment however most trust studies have concentrated on the initial trust and there is little known about how trust beliefs evolve over time the dynamics of trust are of particular importance in the use of infomediaries online information providers among which health infomediaries are the most important for web consumers in dealing with their wellness and health issues we investigate the evolution of trust using the case of health infomediaries the examination of the temporal changes in trust was carried out through two approachescomparative statics and dynamic analyses the research method was laboratory experiment and the data were collected for two episodes of encounters two comparative statics models and one dynamic model were estimated in order to examine the parameter changes from one episode of encounter to the next as well as the dynamics of belief changes the results of analysis show that the structure of trust changes over time and information quality becomes the single most important antecedent in infomediary trust building in the later stages of use furthermore our study also indicates that satisfaction plays an important role in changing web customers trust beliefs contributions as well as research and managerial implications are discussed,Dynamics of Trust Revision: Using Health Infomediaries,Journal of Management Information Systems,2008.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222240409,"['https://openalex.org/W1521696108' 'https://openalex.org/W1544866813'

intense competition requires that social media service providers execute two major business strategies exploiting current functions while simultaneously exploring incremental innovation realization of these strategies is related to two types of member behavior reinforced use and varied use drawing on identity theories we examine the common and differential effects of two levels of social selfidentity—relational identity and social identity—on reinforced and varied use and the moderating role of inertia on their effects on social media usage our results reveal that although both identities have similar effects on usage behavior users with higher social identities are more oriented toward variety seeking while those with stronger relational identities are more oriented toward reinforcement inertia negatively moderates the impacts of social identity on social media use but not the relationships between relational identity and social media use the current research contributes to theory by decomposing social media usage into reinforced and varied use and reveals the common and differential influences of two levels of social selfidentity on user behavior social media service providers should focus more on social identity to promote varied use and focus more on relational identity when they want to enhance reinforced use,Who Do You Think You Are?

despite their potential to significantly reduce transaction costs for both buyers and sellers emarketplaces have struggled recent literature has examined the value propositions of emarketplaces and proposed conceptual frameworks for their analysis in this research we move beyond conceptual analysis by developing a gametheoretic model of returnoninvestment roidriven emarketplace participation growth this model provides insights into expected emarketplace growth and participation and can be used to determine both the viability and expected longrun size of a given emarketplace our results indicate that the pricing policy of the emarketplace intermediary can affect the rate at which participation grows and therefore sentiment about its prospects we focus on emarketplaces that add value to buyers and sellers by increasing the efficiency of administrative tasks but also simultaneously add value to buyers and reduce value to sellers by lowering prices for goods purchased value to participants in these emarketplaces is determined by the volume of transactions that can be conducted using the emarketplace resulting in a twosided network effectbuyers reacting to sellers and sellers reacting to buyers the gametheoretic model identifies an emarketplace equilibrium at which participation growth is predicted to stop,A Game-Theoretic Model of E-Marketplace Participation Growth,Journal of Management Information Systems,2005.0,10.1080/07421222.2003.11045837,"['https://openalex.org/W1553738619' 'https://openalex.org/W1598833883'

this research investigates the effectiveness of various trustbuilding strategies to influence actual buying behavior in online shopping environments particularly for firsttime visitors to an internet store that does not have an established reputation drawing from the literature on trust we developed a model of how trustbuilding strategies could affect trust and the consequences of trust we investigated two trustbuilding strategies portal association based on reputation categorization and trust transference and satisfied customer endorsements based on unit grouping reputation categorization and trust transference a series of two studies was conducted at a large public university in hong kong the first study employed a laboratory experiment to test the model in an online bookstore environment using a real task that involves actual book purchases of the two strategies investigated satisfied customer endorsement by similar peers but not portal association was found to increase consumers trusting beliefs about the store this in turn positively influenced consumers attitudes toward the store and their willingness to buy from the store which ultimately led to actual buying behaviors to gather further insights on the two web strategies investigated a second study was conducted using a questionnaire survey approach overall the findings corroborated those in the first study specifically it shows that endorsements by similar local nonforeign peers but not by dissimilar foreign peers were effective means of developing trust among firsttime visitors to online stores,"Do I Trust You Online, and If So, Will I Buy?

while researchers go to great lengths to justify and prove theoretical links between constructs the relationship between measurement items and constructs is often ignored by default the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct many times though the nature of the construct is not reflective but rather formative formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa in this research we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers by examining complete volumes of mis quarterly and information systems research over the last 3 years we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative constructs for scientific results to be valid we argue that researchers must properly specify formative constructs this paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative constructs on both type i and type ii errors to avoid these errors the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative constructs we also discuss how to address formative constructs within a research model after they are specified,Specifying Formative Constructs in Information Systems Research,MIS Quarterly,2007.0,10.2307/25148814,"['https://openalex.org/W116282327' 'https://openalex.org/W1488533505'

this study extends the view that formal contracts and relational governance function as complements rather than as substitutes we investigate how specific characteristics of service level agreements slas impact relational governance in information technology outsourcing relationships eleven contractual elements categorized into three sla characteristics foundation change and governance characteristics are hypothesized to act as complements of three relational governance attributes relational norms harmonious conflict resolution and mutual dependence data for the study were collected through a survey of south korean it executives results of the study support the fundamental proposition of complementarity between formal contracts and relational governance and indicate that wellstructured slas have significant positive influence on the various aspects of relational governance in it outsourcing relationships however the study also reveals that change characteristics of slas may act as a substitute for relational governance as these characteristics were found to dampen the level of trust and commitment through moderation effects overall the findings support the proposition that welldeveloped slas not only provide a way to measure the service providers performance but also enable effective management of outsourcing engagements through the development of partnershipstyle relationships with high levels of trust and commitment,The Role of Service Level Agreements in Relational Management of Information Technology Outsourcing: An Empirical Study,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650281,"['https://openalex.org/W1490541530' 'https://openalex.org/W1494947576'

jatspjatsboldabstract jatsbold the field of information systems is has evolved for more than three decades although many schools of thought have emerged and even become well established few historical analyses of research paradigms and methodologies have been undertaken one of the rare exceptions is orlikowski amp baroudi 1991 yet the is research community has evolved substantially since 1991 in many aspects a variety of journal outlets have emerged and become well established more attention has been paid to paradigmatic and methodological issues political and professional contexts have also changed noticeably therefore it should be an opportune time for the field to ask ‘what changes are manifested in journal publications’‘is the field making progress regarding pluralism in is research’‘how will the fields publications practices change in the future’ the purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions and in turn reflect on the paradigmatic and methodological progress made since 1991 we examined 1893 articles published in eight major is publication outlets between 1991 and 2001 our findings suggest that the long‐term endeavours of interpretivist researchers might need to continue because the paradigmatic progress appears somewhat inconsequential positivist research still dominates 81 of published empirical research in particular us journals as opposed to european journals tend to be more positivist quantitative cross‐sectional and survey oriented with respect to research design survey research is still the most widely used method 41 although case studies have gained substantial recognition 36 further the increase of qualitative research 30 empirical studies 61 and longitudinal cases 33 at the expense of laboratory experiments 18 might suggest that is researchers have become more interested in obtaining scientific knowledge in real world settings in summary we suggest that the field has been dominated by the positivist paradigm despite calls to the contrary indeed if the field was to truly embrace pluralism it would have to find ways to fundamentally change the publication practices of the journal system including the current tenure and promotion system which pose considerable obstacles for the acceptance of alternative paradigmsjatsp,A paradigmatic and methodological examination of information systems research from 1991 to 2001,Information Systems Journal,2004.0,10.1111/j.1365-2575.2004.00173.x,"['https://openalex.org/W106609810' 'https://openalex.org/W107649598'

jatsp an important area of information systems is research has been the identification of the individuallevel beliefs that enable technology acceptance such as the usefulness reliability and flexibility of a system this study posits the existence of additional beliefs that inhibit usage intentions and thus foster technology rejection rather than acceptance we theorize that these inhibitors are more than just the antipoles of enablers eg the opposite of usefulness or reliability and so are distinct constructs worthy of their own investigation inhibitors are proposed to have effects on usage intentions beyond that of enablers as well as effects on enablers themselves we report on a series of empirical studies designed to test the existence and effects of inhibitors a candidate set of six inhibitors is shown to be distinct from enablers these inhibitors are subsequently tested in a field study of 387 individuals nested within 32 different websites effects at both individual and website unit levels of analysis are tested using multilevel modeling we find that inhibitors have negative effects on usage intentions as well as on enablers and these effects vary contingent upon individual or website unit levels of analysis the overall results support the existence and importance of inhibitors in explaining individual intent to use—or not use—technology jatsp,Identifying and Testing the Inhibitors of Technology Usage Intentions,Information Systems Research,2011.0,10.1287/isre.1100.0295,"['https://openalex.org/W144660154' 'https://openalex.org/W1490933189'

jatsp enterprise systems are used to facilitate the seamless integration and exchange of data between the various departments within an organization in order to achieve this rigidly defined control mechanisms must be in place in the system which safeguard the companys data and protect the company against unauthorized and unintended uses of the system this is ideal for total control however is only achievable to a certain extent the configuration of controls in the enterprise system may have unintended organizational implications due to organizational necessities the purpose of this paper is to present the findings from a company case study where an enterprise system is being used we suggest that the introduction of an enterprise system creates power differentials which serve to increase control in the organization this results in increased rigidity and a possible decrease in organizational flexibility and resilience on the other hand enterprise systems can also cause drift resulting from the unexpected consequences of these power differentials as well as from the role of perceptions of people in solving a problem within the enterprise system this reduction in control may serve in some circumstances as an enabler to organizational resilience jatsp,The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Organizational Resilience,Journal of Information Technology,2007.0,10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000087,"['https://openalex.org/W107583826' 'https://openalex.org/W1517701247'

the rapidly increasing use of outsourcing for it services both in the public and private sectors has attracted much interest from researchers and practitioners alike while early studies of it outsourcing were largely qualitative in nature more recent studies have attempted to analyse the outcomes achieved in quantitative terms this paper is consistent with the latter but goes further by modelling the price performance and contract characteristics that are relevant to it outsourcing a twoequation recursive regression model was used to analyse 48 contracts for it support and maintenance the results did not reveal any quantitatively significant price–performance tradeoff but did suggest that firstterm contracts ie the first ever contract awarded by a client for the provision of a particular it service were more expensive than repeat contracts although competitive tendering did not result in lower prices than directly negotiated contracts it was associated with comparatively better performa,"Modelling the price, performance and contract characteristics of IT outsourcing",Journal of Information Technology,2000.0,10.1080/026839600344302,"['https://openalex.org/W1516798127' 'https://openalex.org/W1519913602'

jatspto attain customer satisfaction service firms invest significant resources to implement customer relationship management crm systems to support internal customer service cs employees who provide service to external customers in both facetoface and virtual channels how cs employees apply sophisticated crm systems to interact with customers and how the mechanisms through which their crm usage affects customer satisfaction vary across service channels and bear important implications we approach these issues by investigating the concept of infusion use defined as cs employees’ assessment of the extent to which they use a crm system to its fullest potential to best support their work in the crmenabled service interaction context drawing on the is success framework and expectation confirmation theory we first formulate a baseline model that explains the direct and indirect mechanisms through which cs employees’ infusion use of crm systems leads to customers’ expectation confirmation which in turn affects customers’ satisfaction we then draw on the lenses of media richness and communication adaptation to theorize why these two mechanisms exert differential influence in facetoface and virtual channels we test the hypotheses by collecting multiwave data from cs employees customers and firm archives of a fortune 500 telecom service firm we find that 1 cs employee infusion use can directly contribute to customer expectation confirmation and indirectly do so through cs employees’ satisfaction with the system ie user satisfaction and 2 the direct mechanism plays a more critical role in the facetoface channel whereas the indirect mechanism is more important in the virtual channel our findings inform managers of the avenues through which employees’ infusion use promotes crmenabled service success across facetoface and virtual service channelsjatsp,How Does Employee Infusion Use of CRM Systems Drive Customer Satisfaction?

jatsp few crosscultural studies have investigated how firms diffuse new information technologies it still fewer have advanced a theoretical perspective on possible cultural effects in a world moving rapidly toward corporate multinationalism this oversight seems notable as foreign managers locate plants and offices in the us and as american managers establish foreign subsidiaries and offices abroad it is important for these managers to know in advance as much as possible about the impact of culture on technological innovation japan and the us are cases in point both have subsidiaries and actively market goods and services in the other country far flung enterprises for which it seems to be a natural coordinating mechanism yet while us companies exploit the advantages of it such as email japanese firms do not the japanese however do utilize fax extensively culture is one fruitful explanation for these differences to examine these two markedly different cultures and the effect of these differences on technological innovation a large japanese airline and financial institution were chosen as representative asian sites the it experiences of 209 japanese knowledge workers are contrasted with those of 711 knowledge workers in comparable firms in the united states on certain dimensions using hofstedes work on culture and social presenceinformation richness theory as grounding it was hypothesized that high uncertainty avoidance in japan and structural features of the japanese written language could explain japanese perceptions about new work technologies such as email and fax furthermore the theoretical conceptualization in the paper attempts to account for japanese departures from the us experience results from empirical tests verified many but not all of the predicted differences between japanese and american knowledge workers in general cultural effects seem to play an important role in the predisposition toward and selection of electronic communications media surprisingly responses to traditional media such as facetoface and telephone were remarkably similar between cultures jatsp,The Effect of Culture on IT Diffusion: E-Mail and FAX in Japan and the U.S.,Information Systems Research,1994.0,10.1287/isre.5.1.23,"['https://openalex.org/W1515402129' 'https://openalex.org/W1557992034'

as online reviews play a decisive role in consumers purchase decisions ecommerce platforms are using review systems strategically to obtain a competitive advantage however the strategic potential can only be leveraged if the review system is designed appropriately research on the design of review systems and the effects of design choices has not yet been summarized or synthesized in a review article we aim to close this gap by providing a scoping review in our synthesis we posit that the design of review systems moderates the impact of online reviews on economic outcomes and the factors that drive the formation of reviews after reviewing current research findings we identify gaps and provide a research agenda covering three key themes design features environments and devices,Design of review systems – A strategic instrument to shape online reviewing behavior and economic outcomes,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,2019.0,10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.004,"['https://openalex.org/W1246328688' 'https://openalex.org/W1487531252'

in this paper i trace social mechanisms for the development and continuation of citizens trust in evoting my research focuses on the processes that give rise to trustrelated behavior and identifies mechanisms that explain trust in evoting i distinguish between initial formation and recurrent manifestation of trust and propose models of causal processes to explain them i frame the research on trust in evoting as a case of political trust in the sociotechnical entity of the electoral authorities and the evoting system and draw from general sociotechnical theories and literature on trust to construct relevant concepts and relationships empirically this theorybuilding exercise traces the process of the initial development of trust in evoting in brazil in the 1990s and the maintenance of this trust in the conduct of brazilian elections since then the social mechanisms of trust that i derive from this study are associated with the process of democratization and continuing care towards adjusting the evoting system to serve legitimate objectives for the conduct of elections the interdependence of citizens perception of the trustworthiness of the technology system and the trustworthiness of the electoral authorities and the fostering of a positive attitude towards it by government policy,Explaining Trust in IT-Mediated Elections: A Case Study of E-Voting in Brazil,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2013.0,10.17705/1jais.00340,"['https://openalex.org/W129782044' 'https://openalex.org/W1486941646'

p this paper examines how information technology it transforms relations across fields of practice within organizations drawing on bourdieus practice theory we argue that the production of any practice involves varying degrees of embodiment ie relying on personal relationships and objectification ie relying on the exchange of objects we subsequently characterize boundaryspanning practices according to their relative degrees of embodiment and objectification we distinguish between marketlike boundaryspanning practices which rely primarily on an objectified mode of practice production from communitylike practices which involve mostly the embodied mode of practice production it is then conceptualized as a medium for sharing objects in the production of practices as such it use allows for the sharing of objects without relying on embodied relationships ppwe use data from an indepth ethnographic case study to investigate how it was used to transform communitylike boundaryspanning practices within an organization into marketlike ones moreover we demonstrate how as it was used to support the exchange and combination of depersonalized objects other aspects of the practice such as the roles of intermediaries and the nature of meetings also changed the related changes in these diverse aspects of a boundaryspanning practice supported the trend toward greater objectification it use also increased visibility of the terms associated with object exchange this increased visibility exposed the inequity of the exchange and encouraged the disadvantaged party to renegotiate the relationshipp,Turning a Community into a Market: A Practice Perspective on Information Technology Use in Boundary Spanning,Journal of Management Information Systems,2006.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222220402,"['https://openalex.org/W123915039' 'https://openalex.org/W1484424927'

jatsponline discussion communities play an important role in the development of relationships and the transfer of knowledge within and across organizations their underlying technologies enhance these processes by providing infrastructures through which groupbased communication can occur community administrators often make decisions about technologies with the goal of enhancing the user experience but the impact of such decisions on how a community develops must also be considered to shed light on this complex and underresearched phenomenon we offer a model of key latent constructs influenced by technology choices and possible causal paths by which they have dynamic effects on communities two important community characteristics that can be impacted are community size number of members and community resilience membership that is willing to remain involved with the community in spite of variability and change in the topics discussed to model community development we build on attraction–selection–attrition asa theory introducing two new concepts participation costs how much time and effort are required to engage with content provided in a community and topic consistency cues how strongly a community signals that topics that may appear in the future will be consistent with what it has hosted in the past we use the proposed asa theory of online communities ocasa to develop a simulation model of community size and resilience that affirms some conventional wisdom and also has novel and counterintuitive implications analysis of the model leads to testable new propositions about the causal paths by which technology choices affect the emergence of community size and community resilience and associated implications for community sustainabilityjatsp,An Attraction–Selection–Attrition Theory of Online Community Size and Resilience1,MIS Quarterly,2014.0,10.25300/misq/2014/38.3.04,"['https://openalex.org/W112035675' 'https://openalex.org/W112288907'

opinion spammers exploit consumer trust by posting false or deceptive reviews that may have a negative impact on both consumers and businesses these dishonest posts are difficult to detect because of complex interactions between several user characteristics such as review velocity volume and variety we propose a novel hierarchical supervisedlearning approach to increase the likelihood of detecting anomalies by analyzing several user features and then characterizing their collective behavior in a unified manner specifically we model user characteristics and interactions among them as univariate and multivariate distributions we then stack these distributions using several supervisedlearning techniques such as logistic regression support vector machine and knearest neighbors yielding robust metaclassifiers we perform a detailed evaluation of methods and then develop empirical insights this approach is of interest to online business platforms because it can help reduce false reviews and increase consumer confidence in the credibility of their online information our study contributes to the literature by incorporating distributional aspects of features in machinelearning techniques which can improve the performance of fake reviewer detection on digital platforms,Detecting Review Manipulation on Online Platforms with Hierarchical Supervised Learning,Journal of Management Information Systems,2018.0,10.1080/07421222.2018.1440758,"['https://openalex.org/W129305155' 'https://openalex.org/W132470713'

jatsp this paper reports on the theoretical development and empirical validation of a measurement instrument for three information technology it core capabilities in an electronic commerce context the instrument is based on the work of feeny and willcocks 1998 and includes the capabilities ‘information systems isit governance’ ‘business system thinking’ and ‘relationship building’ it was validated using a sample consisting of 179 respondents all of whom were it managers or chief information officers the results demonstrate that the constructs are reliable a coefficients gt 08 and valid a confirmatory factor analysis on the data set yielded a moderately acceptable model fit the model also demonstrated highly significant factor loadings p gt 0001 the paper shows that a respecification of a competing model in which isit governance is split into ‘business it strategic thinking’ and ‘it management’ provides better measures of fit the paper concludes that the core capabilities of it departments are useful constructs for incorporating into future research they are successfully able to predict behaviours that have relatively little overlap recommended further research includes the relationship between capabilities and governance structures as well as further investigation into how it core capabilities are formed and strengthened in organizations jatsp,Measuring it Core Capabilities for Electronic Commerce,Journal of Information Technology,2001.0,10.1080/02683960010028447,"['https://openalex.org/W1487531252' 'https://openalex.org/W1495838591'

within the emerging context of the digitization of health care electronic health records ehrs constitute a significant technological advance in the way medical information is stored communicated and processed by the multiple parties involved in health care delivery however in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion in this study we pose the question can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and optin behavioral intentions toward ehrs and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns to investigate this question we integrate an individuals concern for information privacy cfip with the elaboration likelihood model elm to examine attitude change and likelihood of optingin to an ehr system we theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables we also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude we test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting ehrs we find that an individuals cfip interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of ehrs in addition results suggest that attitude toward ehr use and cfip directly influence optin behavioral intentions an important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing these results as well as other theoretical and practical implications are discussed,Adoption of Electronic Health Records in the Presence of Privacy Concerns: The Elaboration Likelihood Model and Individual Persuasion,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650295,"['https://openalex.org/W1480201135' 'https://openalex.org/W1490774257'

jatsp prior research at the firm level finds information technology it to be a net substitute for both labor and nonit capital inputs however it is unclear whether these results hold given recent it innovations and continued price declines in this study we extend prior research to examine whether these input relationships have evolved over time first we introduce new price indexes to account for varying technological progress across different types of it hardware second we use the rental price methodology to measure capital in terms of the flow of services provided finally we use hedonic methods to extend our it measures to 1998 enabling analysis spanning the emergence of the internet analyzing approximately 9800 observations from over 800 fortune 1000 firms for the years 1987–1998 we find firm demand for it to be elastic for decentralized it and inelastic for centralized it moreover allen elasticity of substitution estimates confirm that through labor substitution the increasing factor share of it comes at the expense of labor last we identify a complementary relationship between it and ordinary capital suggesting an evolution in this relationship as firms have shifted to more decentralized organizational forms we discuss these results in terms of prior research suggest areas of future research and discuss managerial implications jatspjatsp this paper is dedicated to the memory of paul chwelos respected colleague and dear friend jatsp,<b>Research Note</b>—Does Technological Progress Alter the Nature of Information Technology as a Production Input?

employees in many contemporary organizations work with flexible routines and flexible technologies when those employees find that they are unable to achieve their goals in the current environment how do they decide whether they should change the composition of their routines or the materiality of the technologies with which they work the perspective advanced in this paper suggests that the answer to this question depends on how human and material agenciesthe basic building blocks common to both routines and technologiesare imbricated imbrication of human and material agencies creates infrastructure in the form of routines and technologies that people use to carry out their work routine or technological infrastructure used at any given moment is the result of previous imbrications of human and material agencies people draw on this infrastructure to construct a perception that a technology either constrains their ability to achieve their goals or that the technology affords the possibility of achieving new goals the case of a computer simulation technology for automotive design used to illustrate this framework suggests that perceptions of constraint lead people to change their technologies while perceptions of affordance lead people to change their routines this imbrication metaphor is used to suggest how a human agency approach to technology can usefully incorporate notions of material agency into its explanations of organizational change,"When Flexible Routines Meet Flexible Technologies: Affordance, Constraint, and the Imbrication of Human and Material Agencies",MIS Quarterly,2011.0,10.2307/23043493,"['https://openalex.org/W142106382' 'https://openalex.org/W1505563434'

we examine a knowledge management km success model that incorporates the quality of available knowledge and km systems built to share and reuse knowledge such as determinants of users perception of usefulness and user satisfaction with an organizations km practices perceived usefulness and user satisfaction in turn affect knowledge use which in our model is a measure of how well knowledge sharing and reuse activities are internalized by an organization our model includes organizational support structure as a contributing factor to the success of km system implementation data collected from 150 knowledge workers from a variety of organizations confirmed 10 of 13 hypothesized relationships notably the organizational support factors of leadership commitment supervisor and coworker support as well as incentives directly or indirectly supported shared knowledge quality and knowledge use in line with the proposed model the study lends support to the argument that in addition to km systems quality firms must pay careful attention to championing and goal setting as well as designing adequate reward systems for the ultimate success of these efforts this is one of the first studies that encompasses both the supply knowledge contribution and demand knowledge reuse sides of km in the same model it provides more than anecdotal evidence of factors that determine successful km system implementations unlike earlier studies that only deal with knowledgesharing incentives or quality of shared knowledge we present and empirically validate an integrated model that includes knowledge sharing and knowledge quality and their links to the desired outcome—namely knowledge reuse,A Knowledge Management Success Model: Theoretical Development and Empirical Validation,Journal of Management Information Systems,2006.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222230311,"['https://openalex.org/W1485535210' 'https://openalex.org/W1512488243'

jatsp in the paradigm of servicecentric computing new valueadded applications can be developed dynamically and flexibly by combining and integrating existing services while software applications are traditionally specified and implemented as a set of functions uniform to all users this new paradigm allows the same software service to be delivered with a different price response time availability and other nonfunctional attributes to accommodate different modes of use these nonfunctional attributes together are referred to as quality of service qos when creating a new composite service negotiation makes it possible for a service provider to offer the service with the qos properties customized to the needs of a user automated negotiation tactics require the specification of reservation values for the qos attributes we present a methodology that determines the reservation values a user or broker should use for each component service based on the user’s minimum requirements for the composite service our methodology maximizes the chance of reaching a successful negotiation outcome while staying within the user’s reservation values for the composite service we show that the problem of determining the user’s reservation values for component services can be modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem and then transformed to a singleobjective optimization problem using a maxmin approach the formulation can incorporate providers different qos preferences to increase the chance of negotiation success we identify problem instances for which closedform solutions can be found for the reservation values we show how the method of setting reservation values can be incorporated into a negotiation process that uses extant concession and tradeoff tactics simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach if some providers accept offers before the negotiation process deadline we show that dynamically changing the reservation values for the remaining providers makes the overall negotiation process more likely to succeed jatspjatsp the online appendix is available at httpsdoiorg101287isre20160678  jatsp,How High Should We Go?

jatspecho chambers and filter bubbles are potent metaphors that encapsulate widespread public fear that the use of social media may limit the information that users encounter or consume online specifically the concern is that social media algorithms combined with tendencies to interact with likeminded others both limits users’ exposure to diverse viewpoints and encourages the adoption of more extreme ideological positions yet empirical evidence about how social media shapes information consumption is inconclusive we articulate how characteristics of platform algorithms and users’ online social networks may combine to shape user behavior we bring greater conceptual clarity to this phenomenon by expanding beyond discussion of a binary presence or absence of echo chambers and filter bubbles to a richer set of outcomes incorporating changes in both diversity and slant of users’ information sources using a data set with over four years of web browsing history for a representative panel of nearly 200000 us adults we analyzed how individuals’ social media usage was associated with changes in the information sources they chose to consume we find differentiated impacts on news consumption by platform increased use of facebook was associated with increased information source diversity and a shift toward more partisan sites in news consumption increased use of reddit with increased diversity and a shift toward more moderate sites and increased use of twitter with little to no change in either our results demonstrate the value of adopting a nuanced multidimensional view of how social media use may shape information consumptionjatsp,Understanding Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles: The Impact of Social Media on Diversification and Partisan Shifts in News Consumption,MIS Quarterly,2020.0,10.25300/misq/2020/16371,[],4,4,"articlejatsp, authors, available articlejatsp, data, development, information, isj, issue, jatsp, jatspno","social, data, media, online, social media, platform, content, users"
with the popularity of questionandanswer qa communities widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge has become more viable than ever before however those contributing highquality professional scientific knowledge are confronted with the challenge of making their contributions popular since non expert readers may not recognize the importance of their contributions given the massive amount of information available online in this study we show that non expert readers are capable of evaluating the professionalism of content contributed in such communities as well as experts however we discovered that a salient discrepancy exists between the content non experts favor and the content they perceive as professional in line with studies that have suggested that writing techniques play an important role in how expert content is received by lay persons we investigated how the use of linguistic devices affects both the perceived professionalism and the popularity of contributions in qa communities based on both secondary data and a scenariobased survey we identified specific linguistic devices that can increase content popularity without reducing perceived professionalism additionally we revealed linguistic devices that increase popularity at the expense of perceived professionalism in this context finally we conducted a laboratory experiment to more firmly establish the causal effects of the linguistic device use the triangulated findings have important implications for both research and practice on communicating scientific knowledge in qa communities,Scientific Knowledge Communication in Online Q&amp;A Communities: Linguistic Devices as a Tool to Increase the Popularity and Perceived Professionalism of Knowledge Contributions,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2019.0,10.17705/1jais.00563,"['https://openalex.org/W1595408047' 'https://openalex.org/W160803480'

jatspjatsboldabstract jatsbold this article argues that one way of understanding the role of technical developments in computers is to consider them as solutions looking for problems rather than as solutions to pre‐existing problems this reversal of popular opinion is premised on an analysis of the way that boundaries are drawn around the domain of the ‘technical’ such that computer users can be kept at a distance and their interpretation of computer user problems ‘managed’ more or less successfully by those purporting to resolve such problems the result is that users are faced with a labour of sisyphus just when they thought they had resolved their problems another technical ‘advance’ suddenly appears and generates another problem an awareness of the social framework for such developments may facilitate a clearer appreciation of the role of the problem solver in the construction of the problem itselfjatsp,Sisyphus and the social construction of computer user problems,Information Systems Journal,1995.0,10.1111/j.1365-2575.1995.tb00086.x,"['https://openalex.org/W1492164922' 'https://openalex.org/W2039191423'

there is a growing focus on achieving “openness” in the design and transformation of organizations in which the enabling role of icts is considered increasingly central however bureaucratic organizations with rigid structures continue to face significant challenges in moving towards more open forms of organizing in this paper we contribute to our understanding of these challenges by building on existing conceptualizations of openness as a form of boundary work that transforms by challenging both internal and external organizational boundaries in particular we draw on a performative view derived from actornetwork theory to analyze a case study of ictbased administrative reforms in a judicial system building on our case analysis we develop a typology of the various roles that icts can play in both enabling and constraining ongoing boundary work within the context of their implementation we thus present a view of ictenabled open organizing as a process where icts contribute to problematizing shifting and augmenting ongoing boundary work this view highlights the inherently equivocal nature of the role of icts in transformations towards higher levels of openness,"Designing for ICT-Enabled Openness in Bureaucratic Organizations: Problematizing, Shifting, and Augmenting Boundary Work",Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2019.0,10.17705/1jais.00548,[],4,0,"articlejatsp, authors, available articlejatsp, data, development, information, isj, issue, jatsp, jatspno","systems, information, development, paper, case, software, management, technology"
advances in genetic testing and data mining technologies have increased the availability of genetic information to insurance companies and insureds applicants and policy holders in the individual health insurance market ihim regulators concerned that insurance companies will use this information to discriminate against applicants who have a genetic risk factor but who are still healthy have implemented genetic privacy legislation in at least 18 states however in previous work we have demonstrated that such legislation will have unintended consequences  it will reduce consumer participation in the market without making those remaining better off this paper identifies a mechanism a pure bundling strategy that insurance companies may implement in this regulatory environment to restore or maximize consumer participation in the market and to discourage such discrimination among insureds this problem is examined through system dynamics a simulationbased modeling technique the results will have significant implications for policy designs implemented by insurance companies and for legislation implemented by industry regulators and therefore for the insurability of the individuals that rely on this market for health insurance coverage,Managing the Costs of Informational Privacy: Pure Bundling as a Strategy in the Individual Health Insurance Market,Journal of Management Information Systems,2000.0,10.1080/07421222.2000.11045639,"['https://openalex.org/W1496065418' 'https://openalex.org/W1501403204'

our first paper by tom butler is an additional contribution to our special issue of last time volume 13 number 2 2003 we have been impressed by the quality of submissions in our special issues and we aim to have at least one of these per year so if you have any suggestions for others or indeed if you might edit one in the future please let us know but be warned there is the same rigorous refereeing process as for conventional papers the question that tom butler addresses is whether the development of webbased information systems is gives rise to the same social and organizational problems that arise with other applications development readers may not be surprised by the answer – the fundamental nature of is development processes does not change because the applications happen to be web based what is particularly interesting however is the authors use of institutional theory to illustrate ‘how the commitments of social actors influence and shape organizational endeavours’ the research approach used is casebased research in one organization and this provides an indepth look at web development there are numerous citations from the actors which brings the organization to life of course the potential criticism of such research is that it is more difficult to generalize than say a survey of many companies however the tradition of the information systems journal isj is to support indepth research john mingers provides an excellent overview of multimethod research in is it might surprise readers to learn that although multimethod research is espoused by many leading researchers in the field evidence of such research is not common and even when it does occur it refers mainly to a mix of traditional approaches we think that these findings are disappointing but important this paper might be usefully read in conjunction with our earlier paper of joe nandhakumar and matthew jones 1997 the isj has been in the forefront of those journals encouraging submissions of papers that offer originality in research approach as well as content and general contribution and we take this opportunity to state again our welcome for multimethod research along with other papers that take a less conventional research approach the third paper of vassilis serafeimidis and steve smithson returns to a major is research stream over many years that of the evaluation of is however unlike most of its predecessors which look at more formal and positivistic characteristics it concentrates on the organizational roles of the key stakeholders within four evaluation contexts which they refer to as control sensemaking learning and exploratory these are examined as an organization chosen as the case study a uk insurance company changes from an ad hoc evaluation practice to a more businessdriven one is evaluation is seen as a complex humancentred activity that cannot be divorced from its organizational context another important research theme concerns the adoption of is by organizations erja mustonenollila and kalle lyytinen present a longitudinal study that looks at 200 is process innovation adoption decisions in three organizations originally part of the same company over four decades although they find that some adoptions can be explained by the factors that rogers 1995 identified in his classic text the authors also suggest extensions to rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory however a major observation from the study is that ‘a large number of is process innovation adoptions followed no discernable pattern’ such challenging conclusions will hopefully lead to other researchers following up this study,Editorial,Information Systems Journal,2003.0,10.1046/j.1365-2575.2002.00127.x-i3,[],4,3,"articlejatsp, authors, available articlejatsp, data, development, information, isj, issue, jatsp, jatspno","authors, journal, isj, issue, research, papers, editors, review"

jatspin times of accelerated digital transformation many organizations still struggle to put enterprise systems to effective use quickly while prior work suggests either system or task complexity as a source for these difficulties this case study of a major system implementation at a european bank reveals the most important source to be the complexity arising from codependency between the system and the task we conceptualize this codependency as inherent in systemenabled tasks by proposing system dependency the extent to which a task is supported by a system and semantic dependency the degree to which semantic understanding is required for task completion together these dependencies create representational complexity which constrains users from achieving effective use in systemenabled tasks and can explain differences in achieving effective use through variations in learning effort the concepts and insights emerging from this study provide researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding of what complexity means and why in some contexts learning how to use systems effectively takes longerjatsp,Achieving Effective Use When Digitalizing Work: The Role Of Representational Complexity,MIS Quarterly,2020.0,10.25300/misq/2020/14583,[],4,0,"articlejatsp, authors, available articlejatsp, data, development, information, isj, issue, jatsp, jatspno","systems, information, development, paper, case, software, management, technology"

the first of five papers in this issue by katherine chudoba eleanor wynn mei lu and mary watsonmanheim looks at virtual teams in global organizations as the authors make clear there are different aspects to virtuality in general terms this involves some combination of geography timezone organization national culture work practices and technology differences their study of virtual teams at intel reveals that all these factors do not necessarily reduce team performance particularly if there is work practice predictability and sociability the observation that distance alone does not impact on virtual collaboration contradicts some earlier studies although cultural and work practice diversity along with employee mobility do affect performance negatively the authors propose a virtuality index a measure of virtuality to help practitioners assess the likely impact in different situations this measure may influence funding and other support for virtual teams given by global organizations david gwillim ken dovey and bernhard wieder look at the practice of postimplementation evaluation reviews at the australian offices of two global organizations previous research suggests that few companies engage in such reviews the authors examine the influence of political factors in this practice suggesting they discourage such reviews power interests might determine what how when and whether to evaluate on the other hand their research at least judged by these two case studies plays down the influences of cost time and problems of measurement as reasons for neglecting ex post evaluation cost was an important element in information technology it governance however in ex ante expenditure – the need to control expenditure was seen as essential before projects got underway information relating to the two case studies was collected through a number of semistructured interviews along with a study of the documentation transaction costs and goodwill trust are seen to play a significant role in the way organizations use internet technologies to manage their relationships with customers and suppliers in electronic markets the significance of the contribution of raluca bunduchi lies in the role that the two dimensions play together in shaping the use of electronic markets by analysing the transactional and collaborative use of it in these relationships this empirical research follows a qualitative multicase study approach involving companies in the petroleum and energy sectors using semistructured interviews and with a study of the documentation as with the paper by david gwillim and colleagues use is made of several citations from the interviews raluca bunduchi uses the grounded theory technique of open coding to analyse the data and develops causal networks to bring out the interplay of the two dimensions studied debbie tesch ruth miller james jiang and gary klein look at the role of expectations in the final satisfaction of users in information systems is in particular they examine expectations related to perceived performance and also related to what might be termed realistic expectations the authors look in particular at skill levels of participants and the more intangible and difficult factor of the perceived skill level of users and providers in this research the is departmental directors and staff members of a number of organizations were contacted and their most recent project was used for the study in each case one user and the is director were surveyed to provide information about skill levels and expectations in addition is users completed a questionnaire relating to their satisfaction of the project over 100 matched pairs were collected on a single project the results from this research suggest that these expectations of is users and providers need to be managed carefully systems development success is enhanced if there is a match of expectations among the various stakeholders in our last paper tor larson and linda levine look at the discipline of is this has been a source of much debate over a long period but in order to make our discipline more ‘respectable’ perhaps we do need to agree some core areas using a coword analysis approach in relevant publications they suggest 62 specific centres of coherence the authors also discuss the relevance vs rigor debate for the editors of the information systems journal we have always been concerned that our journal is relevant to the concerns of practice and academics who have interests firmly steeped in practice indeed as we have seen one of the papers in this edition has two coauthors from intel and the other papers use a study of organizations as a basis of their findings but we do not believe that relevance is inconsistent with rigour as the authors here suggest ‘practice is not divorced from theory but a real world test function for theory’ further we have interpreted the discipline of is broadly and we see many other disciplines relevant to is tor and linda ask whether their centres of coherence will change over time we certainly think so and hope so as this is surely one of the signs of an interesting and

jatsp today the reputation of a firm is profoundly influenced by user opinions expressed in online consumer reviews managing these opinions is therefore critical for the success of firms we study the problem of devising an appropriate opinion management strategy or response strategy for a firm to respond to online customer reviews to unravel the underlying mechanics of the problem we develop a stochastic differential equation model that describes the evolution of review ratings over time for a given response strategy employed by the firm this model is validated using data on online customer reviews and firm responses from two of the world’s largest online travel agents when pitted against popular benchmark models such as autoregressive moving average generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity moving average exponential smoothing and naive method our approach not only achieves comparable often better predictive performance it is also able to incorporate the response strategy into the datageneration process underlying the review ratings our approach therefore is not just predictive but more importantly one that can be used in a prescriptive sense namely to prescribe a response strategy that controls review ratings in a desired manner we operationalize the theoretical response strategy in our stochastic model to an operational prescription that a firm can implement and show the applicability of our approach for different business objectives such as mean control meanvariance control and servicelevel control finally we demonstrate the flexibility of the stochastic differential equation model by extending it to encompass multiple state variables jatspjatsp the online appendices are available at httpsdoiorg101287isre20180805  jatsp,Prescribing Response Strategies to Manage Customer Opinions: A Stochastic Differential Equation Approach,Information Systems Research,2019.0,10.1287/isre.2018.0805,"['https://openalex.org/W1597406287' 'https://openalex.org/W1973774762'

information infrastructures typically evolve in an incremental fashion through partly planned and unplanned processes a significant mechanism of growth is when previously unconnected systems are integrated facilitating the transition from networking to internetworking conversely failure to integrate systems contributes to the lack of evolution of the infrastructure integration seems crucial for evolving infrastructures however there is little consensus on what it entails as can be seen when different connotations of integration are unpacked in contrast to the dominant view of integration as a largely technical concern our focus is on how political and institutional interests are embedded in efforts to achieve integration more specifically we explore strategies for institutional integration that take into account uneven distribution of political influence the paper builds on empirical material from our ongoing 2001 – 2008 involvement with the problem of fragmented information systems in the health care sector in india the case is seen from the perspective of one small actor offering free opensource software that is already being used in several other developing countries choosing to focus on a small actor highlights the asymmetric power relations among the actors our actor has no other option than to seek to align with bigger and more influential actors we analyse the strategies the configurable politics and the outcomes of the distinct configurations that emerge from this form of asymmetric integration,Configurable Politics and Asymmetric Integration: Health e-Infrastructures in India,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2009.0,10.17705/1jais.00198,"['https://openalex.org/W134753977' 'https://openalex.org/W1495886451'

information systems are becoming increasingly critical to the daily operations and success of many firms this combined with the rising investments in design and development of these systems make implementation a high priority research topic although information systems implementation has been a topic of interest to researchers over the past two decades the extent to which the existing body of research reflects substantial and cumulative development is not entirely clearthe objective of this study is to conduct a rigorous and quantitative review of the empirical dss implementation literature as a basis for providing guidelines for implementation management and conduct of future research metaanalysis of 144 findings from3 3 studies indicates that usersituational variables involvement training and experience are more important than psychological factors to dss implementation success and that usersituational variables can improve the implementation success by as much as 30 percent furthermore the metaanalytic findings regarding the methodological characteristics of studies provide useful insights for the design of future research studies of implementation the findings also allow us to put into perspective the incremental contribution of additional substantive and empirical studies in this area additionally several specific domains eg construct validation research on user involvement and causal modeling might profit most form future research efforts,Revisiting DSS Implementation Research: A Meta-Analysis of the Literature and Suggestions for Researchers,MIS Quarterly,1992.0,10.2307/249703,"['https://openalex.org/W1484927864' 'https://openalex.org/W1493400060'

jatsp despite the rapid growth of online food delivery ofd market the impact of its threesided nature—encompassing consumers restaurants and gig drivers—on incentives and payoffs remains unclear compared to the traditional twosided model this study examines how ofd platforms make optimal choices in a competitive environment involving pricing and service quality the analysis reveals that insights from twosided platforms don’t seamlessly translate to ofd markets the triad nature of ofd can either dampen or heighten price competition in the buyerseller market altering subsidization dynamics for platforms while conventional platforms suffer from negative network effects due to participation pressure ofd platforms can adapt service strategies to mitigate this however introducing gig labor might not always benefit ofd platforms as it could trigger a prisoner’s dilemma situation by empowering competing platforms the study underscores the dependence of platform strategies on network effects’ strength as the gig economy rises the employment status of gig workers garners controversy the study demonstrates that implementing minimum wage regulations while benefiting gig drivers might diminish societal welfare these findings offer guidance to policymakers aiming to balance gig workers’ interests with overall societal concerns jatsp,Dinner at Your Doorstep: Service Innovation via the Gig Economy on Food Delivery Platforms,Information Systems Research,2024.0,10.1287/isre.2022.0119,"['https://openalex.org/W1970233606' 'https://openalex.org/W1978978112'

advancements in artificial intelligence ai technologies are rapidly changing the competitive landscape in the search for an appropriate strategic response firms are currently engaging in a large variety of ai projects however recent studies suggest that many companies are falling short in creating tangible business value through ai as the current scientific body of knowledge lacks empiricallygrounded research studies for explaining this phenomenon we conducted an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of machine learning ml in 29 different companies through an inductive qualitative analysis we uncover three broad types and five subtypes of ml value creation mechanisms identify necessary but not sufficient conditions for successfully leveraging them and observe that organizations in their efforts to create value dynamically shift from one ml value creation mechanism to another by reconfiguring their ml applications ie the shifting practice we synthesize these findings into a process model of ml value creation which illustrates how organizations engage in resource orchestration by shifting between ml value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and business conditions change our model provides an alternative explanation for the current high failure rate of ml projects,Shifting ML value creation mechanisms: A process model of ML value creation,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,2022.0,10.1016/j.jsis.2022.101734,"['https://openalex.org/W1543768025' 'https://openalex.org/W1671250292'

jatsp the economic dominance of large internet tech companies specifically the ‘big five’ google apple meta née facebook amazon and microsoft is fundamentally complicating the organisation of society their positions raise profound questions old and new at the intersection of information systems and political philosophy where companies have traditionally appeared in liberal democracies as economic operators rather than powerful political actors that threaten to limit citizens’ fundamental rights significantly through their operations importantly the traditional understanding of corporate social responsibility is rooted in the liberaldemocratic conception of moral labour’s division between public and private powers in a market economy focussing on this division the paper analyses the various types of political power these companies wield and the complexities of regulating that power thus it contributes to the is discipline’s theoretical discussion by introducing political theory concepts that hold untapped potential for reconciling big tech and modern liberaldemocratic conceptions of society taking these concepts as underpinnings for discussing six types of power in turn business vs politics democratic government institutions of a market economy companies civil society and citizens the paper offers the discipline example research questions to tackle and points to potential directions for scholarship jatsp,"Big Tech’s power, political corporate social responsibility and regulation",Journal of Information Technology,2023.0,10.1177/02683962221113596,"['https://openalex.org/W1482145245' 'https://openalex.org/W1498589520'

jatsp with this article we contribute to the recent debate regarding the role of transaction cost economics in it outsourcing and software development outsourcing research our focus is on the contracttype choice for shortterm software development outsourcing for this purpose we critically examine transaction cost economics and the extant it outsourcingsoftware development outsourcing literature and propose a framework which classifies software development outsourcing transactions according to transaction frequency and transaction investment characteristics the framework identifies shortterm software development outsourcing as an occasional idiosyncratic transaction based on this groundwork we clarify the concept of shortterm contract and put forward that such a transaction is governed by a shortterm contract following transaction cost economics and control theory our resulting theoretical considerations infer that for shortterm software development outsourcing the vendor’s high human asset specificity and the resulting behaviourbased outcome control the monitoring of the developer staff are the triggers for contracttype decisions accordingly staff monitoring by the client should result in time amp material contracts whereas staff monitoring by the vendor should result in fixed price contracts we develop corresponding hypotheses which we test with 468 specific contract records for shortterm software development outsourcing the results confirm the transaction cost economics–based recommendations for contracttype choice we therefore conclude that the advice of the transaction cost economics to use certain governance structures according to transaction attributes is also applicable to it outsourcingsoftware development outsourcing transactions we suggest further exploration of specific contract records to substantiate our results jatsp,The contract-type choice for short-term software development outsourcing: The role of behaviour-based formal control,Journal of Information Technology,2021.0,10.1177/0268396220967669,"['https://openalex.org/W143055381' 'https://openalex.org/W1489731037'

the limited information provided by peertopeer p2p lending platforms often is not sufficient for lenders to determine if a borrower is trustworthy and able to repay the loan using a unique dataset from a p2p lending platform which allows lenders to seek information directly from borrowers and borrowers to respond to the questions and comments we examine the impact of lenderborrower communication on funding outcomes and loan performance our results show that not only the amount but also the content of such direct communication matters specifically the number of lender comments is negatively associated with funding success while the number of borrower responses is positively associated with funding success although only comments help reduce the final interest rate the role of the communication is even stronger for listings with poor credit grades moreover lenders are influenced by other lenders positive or negative comments and the quality of the information disclosed in borrower responses can affect funding outcomes loan performance eg default ratio however cannot be predicted based on the amount of lender borrower communication this research broadens and deepens our understanding of the roles of information disclosure social influence information quality and trust in economic exchanges in online settings,Cheap Talk?

jatsp technology implementation at the individual level within an organization after the organization has adopted the technology has been an ongoing challenge in every field in this study we develop a hierarchical bayesian learning model to examine the impact of social learning through both targeted early adopter effects and general peer effects and experiential learning on the information technology implementation process by physicians in a community health system our unique data allow us to disentangle the most common and challenging endogeneity issues associated with most social influence studies we find that the experiential learning signal is more accurate than the social learning signals in the technology implementation process and between the two types of social learning signals studied here targeted early adopter effects are much more informative than general peer effects furthermore we experiment with several policy simulations to illustrate and quantify the two different types of social influence on this implementation process the simulation results suggest that maintaining consistency in technology usage by targeted early adopters is more effective than increasing the frequency of their technology usage in reducing their colleagues’ perceptions of uncertainty about the new technology more specifically we find that technology implementation probability would increase a by 15 on average by adding a targeted early adopter to a group without early adopters b by 25 by adding peer effects to solo users and c by 47 by adding early adopter effects to solo users the model can be adapted and generalized to other similar settings that examine social influence on the technology implementation process and also provide quantifiable measures of the improvements that the interventions may produce jatsp,Quantifying the Impact of Social Influence on the Information Technology Implementation Process by Physicians: A Hierarchical Bayesian Learning Approach,Information Systems Research,2018.0,10.1287/isre.2017.0746,"['https://openalex.org/W1485623843' 'https://openalex.org/W1538699542'

jatsp the concept of computer selfefficacy cse recently has been proposed as important to the study of individual behavior toward information technology this paper extends current understanding about the concept of selfefficacy in the context of computer software we describe how two broad types of computer selfefficacy beliefs general selfefficacy and taskspecific selfefficacy are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general cse beliefs will strongly predict subsequent specific cse beliefs the theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of cse beliefs over time within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for handson experience and practice with different software consistent with the findings of prior research judgments of selfefficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort ease of use associated with technology usage further we theorize that selfefficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14week period the emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques results largely support the relationships posited jatsp,Research Report: The Evolving Relationship Between General and Specific Computer Self-Efficacy—An Empirical Assessment,Information Systems Research,2000.0,10.1287/isre.11.4.418.11876,"['https://openalex.org/W121263515' 'https://openalex.org/W1490774257'

jatspdespite extensive deliberations in contemporary literature the design of citizencentric egovernment websites remains an unresolved theoretical and pragmatic conundrum operationalizing egovernment service quality to investigate and improve the design of egovernment websites has been a much soughtafter objective yet there is a lack of actionable guidance on how to develop egovernment websites that exhibit high levels of service quality drawing from marketing literature we undertake a goal approach to this problem by delineating egovernment service quality into aspects of itmediated service content and service delivery whereas service content describes the functions available on an egovernment website that assist citizens in completing their transactional goals service delivery defines the manner by which these functions are made accessible via the web interface as a delivery channel we construct and empirically test a research model that depicts a comprehensive collection of webenabled service content functions and delivery dimensions desirable by citizens empirical findings from an online survey of 647 respondents attest to the value of distinguishing between service content functions and delivery dimensions in designing egovernment websites both service content and delivery are found to be significant contributors to achieving egovernment service quality these itmediated service content functions and delivery dimensions represent core areas of egovernment website design where the application of technology makes a difference especially when considered in tandem with the type of transactional activity a split sample analysis of the data further demonstrates our model’s robustness when applied to egovernment transactions of varying frequencyjatsp,It-Mediated Customer Service Content and Delivery in Electronic Governments: An Empirical Investigation of the Antecedents of Service Quality1,MIS Quarterly,2013.0,10.25300/misq/2013/37.1.04,"['https://openalex.org/W1484681550' 'https://openalex.org/W1486588220'

jatsp knowledge management has become a major trend since the mid1990s different professional communities among them information systemsinformation technology isit and more business managementoriented actors have created strong conceptual ties with the idea of managing knowledge this paper studies the structure and development of the knowledge management discourse over an 18year period with an emphasis on the role of the isit community in shaping this discourse in order to do so a content analysis of 434 article abstracts from the abiinform database referring to ‘knowledge management’ was performed the argument here is based on a theoretical framework derived from recent theorizing about popular management knowledge as fashion and it is assumed that different professional or ‘speech communities’ gathering around a concept such as knowledge management enter into competition for limited organizational resources the papers findings show the coexistence of two distinct speech communities involved in the knowledge management debate focusing on either isit or general management issues and they support the idea that both communities engage in a joint effort at sustaining knowledge management as a fashion field jatsp,The Knowledge Management Tussle – Speech Communities and Rhetorical Strategies in the Development of Knowledge Management,Journal of Information Technology,2001.0,10.1080/02683960110054807,"['https://openalex.org/W1517701247' 'https://openalex.org/W1538506815'

abstract the importance of building relationships with customers and trust in the services provider is well documented in the marketing literature conceptually we extend this logic to the context of internal information technology it services operations through the notion of the service delivery chain the purpose of the study is to examine how key service mechanisms in operational it implementation are related to employee perceptions of actual system benefits and trust in the it services provider we report on a study with 380 employees of 14 bank affiliates that were recently acquired by a bank holding company the focus of the study is on postimplementation trust rather than preimplementation or initial trust and the service provider is viewed as the object of trust rather than the technology our findings suggest that training trial and social influence are key service mechanisms an it services provider can use to stimulate trust in the it services provider and the realization of system benefits keywords it servicesmandated systemsrelational trustservice delivery chainservice mechanisms,Connecting IT Services Operations to Services Marketing Practices,Journal of Management Information Systems,2010.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222260403,"['https://openalex.org/W1212836883' 'https://openalex.org/W1480415088'

as user interactions have become more central to specific classes of information systems design theorizing must expand to support the processes of interaction and the evolution of information systems this theorizing goes beyond useraided participatory design to consider users as designers in their own right during the ongoing creation and recreation of information systems recent theorizing about an emerging class of tailorable systems proposes that such systems undergo an initial primary design process where features are built in prior to general release following implementation people engage in a secondary design process where functions and content emerge during interaction modification and embodiment of the system in use this case study reveals that people are engaged designers framed by dualities in behaviors including planned and emergent behaviors and participatory and reifying behaviors we contribute to design science research by extending work on tailorable systems investigating processes of secondary design in a highly interactive system suited to support user engagement we also contribute more broadly to design science research by explicitly extending behavioral aspects associated with the use of information system artifacts,Secondary Design: A Case of Behavioral Design Science Research,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2011.0,10.17705/1jais.00278,"['https://openalex.org/W105676793' 'https://openalex.org/W129071309'

jatsp in this study we seek to better understand the value of information technology it in supply chain contexts grounded in the resourcebased theory in conjunction with transaction cost economics we develop a conceptual model that links three itrelated resources backend integration managerial skills and partner support to firm performance improvement the model differs from previous studies by proposing a moderating effect of competition on the resourceperformance relationships using data of 743 manufacturing firms our analysis indicates significant contribution of it to supply chains which is generated through development of the digitally enabled integration capability and manifested at the process level along the supply chain the technological resource alone however does not hold the answer to it value creation in fact managerial skills which enable adaptations on supply chain processes and corporate strategy to accommodate the use of it are shown to play the strongest role in it value creation furthermore backend integration and managerial skills are found to be more valuable in more competitive environments while commoditylike resources have diminishing value under competition integrational and managerial resources become even stronger overall our results shed light on the key drivers of itenabled supply chains and provide insights into how competition shapes it value jatsp,<b>Research Note</b>—Information Technology in Supply Chains: The Value of IT-Enabled Resources Under Competition,Information Systems Research,2009.0,10.1287/isre.1080.0195,"['https://openalex.org/W1485916023' 'https://openalex.org/W1487531252'

highquality customer service is an integral part of any successful enterprise but providing it can be a challenge for online merchants especially when customers are complaining about each other this study examines how justice and trust affect user acceptance of ecustomer services by conducting an online experiment involving 380 participants the results suggest that trust in the ecustomer service fully mediates the effects of trust in the service representative and procedural justice on intentions to reuse the ecustomer service furthermore the effect of distributive justice on trust in the ecustomer service was fully mediated by trust in the eservice representative finally the effect of informational justice on user intentions to reuse the ecustomer service was partially mediated by trust in the service representative and trust in the ecustomer service theoretical and practical implications are further discussed,In Justice We Trust: Predicting User Acceptance of E-Customer Services,Journal of Management Information Systems,2008.0,10.2753/mis0742-1222240405,"['https://openalex.org/W1521879244' 'https://openalex.org/W1541900693'

jatstitleabstractjatstitlejatspvirtual worlds or three‐dimensional computer‐based simulated environments have received considerable attention as platforms for entertainment education and commerce in contrast to a web site for example where a user interacts with a two‐dimensional site virtual worlds provide a platform in which users can interact with other individuals sometimes including strangers within three‐dimensional environments virtual worlds afford a form of ‘socialness’ unlike many other technologies often motivating a user – by virtue of these social experiences – to return drawing on the spatial model of interaction and awareness‐attention theory we demonstrate that besides social aspects which include social awareness and social perception flow experience which is the mental state of being fully absorbed and somewhat lost in time is an essential ingredient in an individuals decision to return to a virtual world we also demonstrate how characteristics of the technology are linked to the social aspects experienced in virtual worlds a laboratory study conducted in a virtual world second life supports our assertions and identifies state predictors of flow that influence individuals intentions to return to the virtual world environmentjatsp,Predicting users' return to virtual worlds: a social perspective,Information Systems Journal,2013.0,10.1111/j.1365-2575.2011.00396.x,"['https://openalex.org/W1481340920' 'https://openalex.org/W1501671793'

jatsp although its popularity is widespread the web is well known for one particular drawback its frequent delay when moving from one page to another this experimental study examined whether delay and two other website design variables site breadth and content familiarity have interaction effects on user performance attitudes and behavioral intentions the three experimental factors delay familiarity and breadth collectively impact the cognitive costs and penalties that users incur when making choices in their search for target information an experiment was conducted with 160 undergraduate business majors in a completely counterbalanced fully factorial design that exposed them to two websites and asked them to browse the sites for nine pieces of information results showed that all three factors have strong direct impacts on performance and user attitudes in turn affecting behavioral intentions to return to the site as might be expected a significant threeway interaction was found between all three factors indicating that these factors not only individually impact a user’s experiences with a website but also act in combination to either increase or decrease the costs a user incurs two separate analyses support an assertion that attitudes mediate the relationship of the three factors on behavioral intentions the implications of these results for both researchers and practitioners are discussed additional research is needed to discover other factors that mitigate or accentuate the effects of delay other effects of delay and under what amounts of delay these effects occur jatsp,"When the Wait Isn’t So Bad: The Interacting Effects of Website Delay, Familiarity, and Breadth",Information Systems Research,2006.0,10.1287/isre.1050.0073,"['https://openalex.org/W1500303984' 'https://openalex.org/W1537887591'

jatstitleabstractjatstitlejatspinformation system is procurement history is replete with poorly executed multimillion dollar procurement decisions yet we barely understand what effective is procurement should look like is procurement is highly challenging as it requires the client to simultaneously select a technology and vendor this paper explores the technology‐vendor selection process through the sensemaking perspective our study develops a sensemaking model for technology‐vendor selection that connects the multiple rounds of client‐vendor communicative actions with the clients sensemaking process we show how the client reconciles fragmented and sometimes conflicting cues and information through three intertwined cycles immediate retrospective and decision sensebreaking occurs as a separate process and not a communicative action when disruptive cues occur persistently and from different vendors over multiple rounds of sensemaking we derive a set of critical factors on the basis of the sensemaking perspective for selecting an appropriate vendor and technical solution these insights in turn help explain many poorly executed is procurement decisionsjatsp,Multiparty sensemaking: A technology‐vendor selection case study,Information Systems Journal,2020.0,10.1111/isj.12263,"['https://openalex.org/W1481560356' 'https://openalex.org/W1482435441'

this paper extends the effortaccuracy framework of cognition by taking into account the perceived strategy restrictiveness of decision aids and tests the extended framework in a context in which online decision aids are used to elicit consumers preferences automate the processing of the preferences and provide product advice for consumers three types of decision aids with different decision strategy support capabilities an additivecompensatory based aid an eliminationbased aid and a hybrid aid supporting both strategies are compared in terms of users perceptions of strategy restrictiveness advice quality and cognitive effort these comparisons are grounded on the properties of normativeness and complementarity of decision strategies employed by the aids a normative strategy takes into account both the users attribute preferences and the relative importance of such preferences and allows for tradeoffs among preferences eg additivecompensatory strategy complementarity indicates support for decision rules based on multiple strategies eg both additivecompensatory and elimination strategies the experimental results support the validity of the extended effortaccuracyrestrictiveness framework and the effects of strategy normativeness but not the effects of strategy complementarity in addition to the perceptions of cognitive effort and advice quality perceived strategy restrictiveness exerts a significant influence on consumers intentions to use online decision aids the additivecompensatory aid is perceived to be less restrictive of higher quality and less effortful than the elimination aid whereas the hybrid aid is not perceived to be any different from the additivecompensatory aid,Interactive Decision Aids for Consumer Decision Making in E-Commerce: The Influence of Perceived Strategy Restrictiveness,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650293,"['https://openalex.org/W1480715147' 'https://openalex.org/W1495036912'
