## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Is my current sample (3,093 papers) too small?
**A:** No! It's actually a good size for many analyses. Expansion is an *enhancement*, not a requirement.

### Q: Will expansion dramatically change my results?
**A:** Probably some changes:
- More research streams likely discovered
- Existing streams may become richer/better defined
- New cross-disciplinary connections
- But core findings should remain stable

### Q: Can I expand incrementally?
**A:** Yes! Great approach:
- Week 1: Add AMJ
- Week 2: Add SMJ
- Week 3: Add ASQ, MS, JBV
- Validate at each step

### Q: What if I don't have Web of Science access?
**A:** Options:
1. Check with your library
2. Use Scopus instead
3. Try OpenAlex API (free, but may have gaps)
4. Collect from publisher sites (more work)

### Q: Will this work on my computer?
**A:** Check requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4+ cores
- Minimum: 8GB RAM (with batch processing)
- Storage: 5-10 GB free space
- OS: Windows/Mac/Linux all work

### Q: How long will the analysis take?
**A:** For recommended expansion (~8,000-10,000 papers):
- Embeddings: 45-60 min
- Clustering: 20-30 min
- OpenAlex enrichment: 2-3 hours
- Networks: 1-2 hours
- Total: ~5-6 hours (can run overnight)
