# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Meaningful IS Research Stream Analysis

## What We Accomplished

### Problem Identified ‚úì
- ‚ùå OpenAlex keywords were showing "Paleontology", "Biology", "Microeconomics"
- ‚ùå Too generic - not meaningful for IS research analysis
- ‚ùå Same broad keywords across different clusters

### Solution Implemented ‚úì
1. **TF-IDF Theme Extraction** from titles + abstracts
2. **IS-specific stopword filtering** (removed "jats", "information", "system", etc.)
3. **Combined citation data** (OpenAlex + CrossRef)
4. **Meaningful cluster naming** based on actual research content

### Results Achieved ‚úì
- ‚úÖ 102 clusters with **meaningful IS-specific themes**
- ‚úÖ **Proper citation metrics** using combined data sources
- ‚úÖ **Interactive dashboard** with theme-based navigation
- ‚úÖ **Clear research streams**: Technology Adoption, E-commerce, Security/Privacy, Digital Transformation, etc.

1. **Technology Adoption / User** - 313.9 mean citations (TAM, acceptance models)
2. **ERP / Project Management** - 216.7 mean citations (Enterprise systems)
3. **Value / Business** - 193.7 mean citations (IT business value)
4. **Knowledge / Virtual / Social** - 165.2 mean citations (KM, collaboration)
5. **Digital / Transformation** - 129.9 mean citations (Digitalization)

### Top 5 Largest Streams:
1. **Online / Social / Consumers** - 1,250 papers (E-commerce)
2. **Technology / Business / Process** - 877 papers (IT management)
3. **Security / Privacy** - 751 papers (Cybersecurity)
4. **Technology Adoption** - 722 papers (TAM)
5. **Development / Design / Software** - 692 papers (Systems development)

## How to Use the Results

### 1. Launch Interactive Dashboard
```powershell
python launch_dashboard.py
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:8050

**Features:**
- **Overview Tab**: Sunburst chart with meaningful theme names
- **Cluster Explorer**: Detailed analysis with proper citations
- **Keywords Tab**: Theme-based keyword networks
- **Statistics Tab**: Impact metrics by level

### 2. Query the Data
```python
import json

# Load cluster names
with open('data/cluster_names_map.json') as f:
    names = json.load(f)

# Show all Level 0 research streams
for cid, info in names['level_0'].items():
    print(f"{info['name']:40} | {info['paper_count']:4} papers | {info['mean_citations']:.1f} avg cites")
```

### 3. Access Full Theme Details
```python
# Load detailed themes
with open('data/cluster_themes.json') as f:
    themes = json.load(f)

# Analyze Technology Adoption stream (Cluster 3)
cluster = themes['level_0']['3']
print(f"Theme: {cluster['theme']}")
print(f"Papers: {cluster['paper_count']}")
print(f"Mean Citations: {cluster['mean_citations']:.1f}")
print(f"Top Keywords:")
for kw, score in cluster['keywords'][:10]:
    print(f"  - {kw}: {score:.3f}")
print(f"\nMost Cited Paper:")
top_paper = cluster['top_papers'][0]
print(f"  {top_paper['Title']} ({top_paper['citations_combined']:.0f} citations)")
```

## Citations Are Now Accurate

### Before:
- Only CrossRef citations (often outdated)
- Missing recent citation counts
- No validation against other sources

### After:
- **OpenAlex** citations (more current, better coverage)
- **CrossRef** fallback for completeness
- **Combined approach** - best of both worlds
- Field: `citations_combined` in all outputs

Example:
- Some papers show 100+ OpenAlex citations vs 50 CrossRef citations
- TAM papers have accurate high citation counts
- Recent papers (2020-2025) now have proper metrics

## Research Stream Examples

### Instead of: "Computer Science, Business, Marketing, Paleontology"
### We Now Have:

**Cluster 0: Online / Social / Consumers**
- Keywords: online, product, trust, reviews, consumers
- Theme: E-commerce and online consumer behavior
- 1,250 papers, 109.5 mean citations

**Cluster 3: Technology Adoption / User**
- Keywords: technology, adoption, user, users, acceptance
- Theme: Technology acceptance models (TAM), user adoption
- 722 papers, 313.9 mean citations ‚≠ê HIGHEST IMPACT

**Cluster 2: Security / Privacy / Social Media**
- Keywords: security, privacy, social, media, compliance
- Theme: Cybersecurity, privacy concerns, data protection
- 751 papers, 114.3 mean citations

**Cluster 7: Digital / Transformation**
- Keywords: digital, technology, social, transformation
- Theme: Digital transformation and digitalization
- 516 papers, 129.9 mean citations

## Next Steps (Optional)

### If You Want to Go Further:

1. **Temporal Analysis**
   - How have research streams evolved 2016-2025?
   - Which streams are growing vs declining?
   - Emerging vs established themes?

2. **Journal Specialization**
   - Which journals focus on which streams?
   - MISQ vs ISR vs JMIS theme differences?
   - Identify best venues for your research
