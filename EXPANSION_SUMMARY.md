# Sample Expansion: Executive Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Current Sample:** 3,093 papers from 4 journals (2016-2025)

---

## TL;DR - Quick Answer

**YES, expansion is highly feasible and recommended!**

### Recommended Expansion
- **Add 5 journals:** AMJ, SMJ, ASQ, MS, JBV
- **Extend time:** 2011-2025 (15 years instead of 10)
- **New total:** ~8,000-10,000 papers (2.6-3.2x increase)
- **Effort:** 4-6 hours data collection + 5-6 hours processing
- **Benefit:** Significantly better coverage of management, strategy, and entrepreneurship research

---

## Why Expand?

### Current Sample Limitations
1. **Journal Coverage:** Only 4 journals (all excellent, but narrow)
   - Missing strategic management (SMJ)
   - Missing empirical management work (AMJ)  
   - Missing entrepreneurship (JBV)
   - Missing quantitative methods (MS)

2. **Time Period:** 10 years is good but...
   - 15-20 years better for temporal analysis
   - Missing pre-2016 foundational work
   - Limited historical perspective

3. **Sample Size:** 3,093 papers is workable but...
   - May miss smaller research streams
   - Limited clustering resolution
   - Weaker citation networks

### What Expansion Provides
1. **Broader Coverage:** Management + Strategy + IS + Entrepreneurship
2. **Better Temporal Analysis:** 15-year window shows evolution
3. **Richer Networks:** More cross-citations and connections
4. **Stronger Findings:** More robust stream identification

## Quick Start Guide

If you want to proceed with expansion:

### Step 1: Decide on Scope (5 minutes)
Choose one:
- [ ] **Conservative:** Add 2-3 journals, extend to 2013 (~6,000 papers)
- [ ] **Recommended:** Add 5 journals, extend to 2011 (~8,000 papers) ⭐
- [ ] **Aggressive:** Add 10+ journals, extend to 2006 (~15,000 papers)

### Step 2: Collect Data (4-6 hours)
1. Access Web of Science (institutional login)
2. For each new journal, run search: Journal + Year Range
3. Export BibTeX (500 records per batch)
4. Save to `data/exports/` folder

**New journals to download (recommended):**
- Academy of Management Journal (AMJ)
- Strategic Management Journal (SMJ)
- Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ)
- Management Science (MS)
- Journal of Business Venturing (JBV)

**Years to add for existing journals:**
- 2011-2015 for: AMR, MISQ, ORSC, ISR

### Step 3: Merge & Validate (30 minutes)
```powershell
# Place all new .bib files in data/exports/
# Then run:
python expand_sample.py --all
```

This will:
- Merge all BibTeX files
- Validate data quality
- Remove duplicates
- Generate statistics report

### Step 4: Update & Re-run Analysis (5-6 hours)
```powershell
# Update the input file in your scripts
# Then run:
python run_full_analysis.py
```

### Step 5: Compare Results (1 hour)
- Review new stream discoveries
- Compare cluster compositions
- Validate findings

**Total time investment:** ~10-12 hours  
**Total benefit:** 2.6-3.2x more papers, much broader coverage

## Key Decisions to Make

### Decision 1: How Many Journals?
| Option | Journals | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Minimal | +0 (stay with 4) | Limited time/resources |
| Conservative | +2-3 | Focus on key gaps (AMJ, SMJ) |
| **Recommended** | **+5** | **Comprehensive yet manageable** ⭐ |
| Aggressive | +10-15 | Complete field mapping |

**Recommendation:** Add 5 journals (AMJ, SMJ, ASQ, MS, JBV)

### Decision 2: How Far Back?
| Option | Years | Papers Added | Rationale |
|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| None | 2016-2025 | 0 | Current sample |
| Recent | 2013-2025 (13yr) | ~1,000 | Recent work only |
| **Recommended** | **2011-2025 (15yr)** | **~2,000** | **Post-crisis + good metadata** ⭐ |
| Extended | 2006-2025 (20yr) | ~4,000 | Full perspective |
| Complete | 2000-2025 (25yr) | ~6,000 | Historical view |

**Recommendation:** Extend to 2011 (15-year window)

### Decision 3: Timeline?
| Option | When to Start | Approach |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Immediate | This week | If data access ready |
| Planned | Next month | Schedule dedicated time |
| **Incremental** | **Over 3-6 months** | **Add journals gradually** ⭐ |
| Defer | Later/never | Stick with current sample |

**Recommendation:** Incremental expansion over 3-6 months

## Computational Feasibility

### Your Current System
The analysis shows you're currently using:
- Windows with PowerShell
- Python environment with required packages
- Successfully ran analysis on 3,093 papers

### Requirements for Expanded Sample (~8,000 papers)

| Resource | Current Need | Expanded Need | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB | Check your system |
| Storage | 2 GB | 5 GB | ✅ Plenty |
| Time | 2 hours | 5-6 hours | ✅ Acceptable |
| Python/packages | Installed | Same | ✅ Ready |

**Bottom line:** If you have 16GB RAM, you're good to go. If only 8GB, still possible with batch processing.

## Data Access Feasibility

### Do You Have Access?
- [ ] Web of Science (via university/institution) ⭐ Best option
- [ ] Scopus (via university/institution) ⭐ Good option  
- [ ] Individual journal subscriptions (varies) - Workable
- [ ] None of the above - More challenging but still possible

**If you have institutional access to Web of Science or Scopus:** 
✅ **Expansion is straightforward!**

**If not:**
- Check if your institution has database access
- Contact library for access
- Consider using OpenAlex API as alternative (free, but may have gaps)

## Need Help Deciding?

### Ask Yourself:

1. **What's my research goal?**
   - Quick exploratory analysis → Keep current sample
   - Comprehensive field mapping → Expand!
   - Publication-quality study → Definitely expand

2. **Do I have data access?**
   - Yes (Web of Science/Scopus) → Expansion is easy
   - No → May need to stay with current or find alternative

3. **What's my timeline?**
   - Need results in 1 week → Keep current
   - Have 1-2 months → Perfect for expansion
   - Long-term project → Definitely expand

4. **What's my computational setup?**
   - <8GB RAM → Keep current or do minimal expansion
   - 16GB RAM → Go for recommended expansion
   - 32GB+ RAM → Consider aggressive expansion

### If Still Unsure:

**Option A: Test Run**
- Add just AMJ (2011-2025)
- See how it changes your results
- Decide whether to continue

**Option B: Hybrid Approach**  
- Keep current sample as "Core analysis"
- Do expanded sample as "Supplementary analysis"
- Compare findings

**Option C: Stay Current**
- Your current sample (3,093 papers) IS valid
- May be sufficient for many research questions
- Can always expand later if needed

## Questions?

All detailed information is in the three documents I created:

1. **EXPANSION_ANALYSIS.md** - Full feasibility analysis
2. **EXPANSION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step instructions
3. **expand_sample.py** - Automation script

**Next step:** Read EXPANSION_ANALYSIS.md to understand all your options!
