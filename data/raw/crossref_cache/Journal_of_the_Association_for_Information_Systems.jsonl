This paper focuses on explicit targeting, a practice where firms saliently (yet subtly) reveal the information used to target consumers in their advertisement text. How to craft ad messages to convey product benefits without triggering privacy concerns is a nontrivial task. Results from a field experiment reveal that consumers respond negatively to explicit targeting, yet such a negative effect can be partially alleviated by using hedonic instead of utilitarian information framing. In a controlled online experiment, we show that explicit targeting increases consumers’ privacy concerns relative to the perceived benefits of personalization, leading to less positive consumer responses. Interestingly, an extension of the online experiment suggests that providing consumers with a clear description of why they are targeted seems to offset the negative effects of explicit targeting. This study offers important academic implications for the personalization literature and valuable practical insights for firms and policymakers.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T21:01:38Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:48Z", "accepted_date": null}

While some observers offer support and engage in inclusion toward victims on social media, other observers blame victims for their plight and participate in revictimization and exclusion. Victim blaming, which can lead to social exclusion, disproportionately impacts those in society who are already at risk for exclusion and may perpetuate existing racial, ethnic, gender, and economic inequalities. This research provides a theoretical framework to identify reasons why observers engage in such wide-ranging responses to victims on social media. Specifically, we consider social inclusion and exclusion at the confluence of a social phenomenon (victim blaming), a theory (just world theory), and an information technology artifact (social media) among a specific type of actor (observers). Our theoretical framework of social media inclusion and exclusion is informed by just world theory and considers how social media functionalities can promote social media inclusion or exclusion. We also offer research questions to stimulate future research related to social media inclusion, social media exclusion, and just world theory.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T14:46:42Z", "created_date": "2023-09-08T19:42:06Z", "deposited_date": "2023-09-08T19:42:15Z", "accepted_date": null}

Based on this practice, we study a business setting in which the management of security outsourcing depends on the security efforts of both the MSSP and its clients, taking into account that their allocation of efforts can change during the contract horizon. Since their efforts are private to each other, a double moral hazard (DMH) problem can arise with the use of bilateral refund contracts, which have been widely adopted in the MSSP industry. Moreover, both the high probability of undirected attacks and system interdependency can exacerbate the DMH problem. We propose two new types of contracts to solve this problem. One is a monitoring contract, in which a cyberinsurance firm monitors the security efforts of the MSSP and its clients. The other is a liability contract, in which both parties take full liability for breaches through rewarding clients who are well protected and penalizing clients who end up being breached by hackers. Our findings show that monitoring contracts can only solve the DMH problem when variable monitoring costs are negligible. Liability contracts can also solve the DMH problem and are worth implementing when an MSSP encounters (1) a high probability of undirected attack, (2) high system interdependency, (3) a long contract horizon, or (4) when both parties have nearly equal responsibility over the course of the contract horizon. We also compare the proposed contracts in two additional settings: when the MSSP has a spillover effect and when the MSSP serves three or more clients.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 13, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-05-15T13:10:06Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T12:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T12:29:11Z", "accepted_date": null}

Does the firm’s ability to use social media affect its proficiency in exploring and exploiting knowledge? What should be the role of business analytics talent in this equation? We study theoretically and empirically these cutting-edge research questions. Our proposed research model argues that social media capability enables the development of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent exerts a positive reinforcing role in the impact of social media on knowledge exploration. We empirically tested the proposed research model with a secondary dataset from a sample of US firms using PLS path modeling. After running a robustness test by estimating eight alternatives/competing models, the empirical analysis revealed that social media capability is positively related to knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, but with a stronger effect on knowledge exploration. Moreover, business analytics talent plays a positive moderator role in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. This study contributes to the IS research by (1) introducing, developing, and operationalizing the concepts of social media capability and business analytics talent; and (2) theoretically arguing and empirically showing the pivotal role of social media capability in exploring new knowledge and the complementary role of business analytics talent.

Although this often offers higher\nefficiency and lower costs, cognitive automation exacerbates the erosion of human skill and expertise\nin automated tasks. Accepting the erosion of obsolete skills is necessary to reap the benefits of\ntechnology—however, the erosion of essential human expertise is problematic if workers remain\naccountable for tasks for which they lack sufficient understanding, rendering them incapable of\nresponding if the automation fails. Though the phenomenon is widely acknowledged, the dynamics\nbehind such undesired skill erosion are poorly understood. Thus, taking the perspective of\nsociotechnical systems, we conducted a case study of an accounting firm that had experienced skill\nerosion over a number of years due to reliance on their software’s automated functions. We synthesized\nour findings using causal loop modeling based on system dynamics. The resulting dynamic model\nexplains skill erosion via an interplay between humans’ automation reliance, complacency, and mindful\nconduction. It shows how increasing reliance on automation fosters complacency at both individual\nand organizational levels, weakening workers’ mindfulness across three work task facets (activity\nawareness, competence maintenance, and output assessment), resulting in skill erosion. Such skill\nerosion may remain obscure, acknowledged by neither workers nor managers.

The results suggest that the retailer executes a more defensive strategy if the threat of the online channel is severe but tends to be cooperative when the threat is less alarming.

One specific type of tension originates from the fact that algorithms often exhibit limited transparency and are perceived as highly opaque, which impedes workers’ understanding of their inner workings. While algorithmic transparency can facilitate sensemaking, the algorithm’s opaqueness may aggravate sensemaking. By conducting an empirical case study in the context of the Uber platform, we explore how platform workers make sense of the algorithms managing them. Drawing on Weick’s enactment theory, we theorize a new form of sensemaking— algorithm sensemaking—and unpack its three sub-elements: (1) focused enactment, (2) selection modes, and (3) retention sources. The sophisticated, multistep process of algorithm sensemaking allows platform workers to keep up with algorithmic instructions systematically. We add to previous literature by theorizing algorithm sensemaking as a mediator linking workers’ perceptions about tensions in their work environment and their behavioral responses.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 49, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-27T10:28:21Z", "created_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:15Z", "deposited_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:18Z", "accepted_date": null}

This article proposes a shift in the discourse to explore how SMOs’ digital activism can promote broader social change through collaborative agreements rather than merely demanding narrow concessions or compliance. We examine the online campaigns of a large international SMO and show how the campaigns influenced three global businesses to alter their environmental practices and industry standards. We find that the SMO used contrasting combinations of content positioning and social networking strategies to mobilize consumers, ultimately achieving collaboration agreements by influencing businesses’ risk perceptions and the potential strategic gains from collaboration with the SMO. The comparative analysis yields insights into how SMOs may vary their digital activism strategies depending on consumers’ loyalty to a business and its offerings, including its products and services. We develop a theoretical perspective that explains why and how consumer loyalty can shape SMOs’ selection of digital activism strategies and the process of achieving collaboration agreements. The findings also advance the literature on digital activism strategies by introducing the notion of ambivalent content positioning and emphasizing the significance of social networking for risk management and sustaining SMOs’ digital activism.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T16:16:35Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:52Z", "accepted_date": null}

Using innovation diffusion, organizing vision (OV), and institutional entrepreneurship theories as the key theoretical lenses, and an in-depth case study reconstructed using 20 years of discourse surrounding Walmart’s campaign in the early stage of diffusion of the RFID-in-retailing technology, we develop a fourphase process model for the early-stage diffusion of codependent IT innovations. We make three specific contributions to the IS discipline, specifically to the literature on IS innovation adoption and diffusion. First, we add the notion of coadopter relative advantage and posit that the organization in the coadopter community with a higher coadopter relative advantage that perceives the highest degree of coadopter relative advantage will emerge as an institutional entrepreneur (IE) and will influence the early-stage diffusion of the codependent IT innovation. Second, we add the notion of an internal-external influencer and posit that the IE may be an actor who is internal to the overall adoption phenomenon, which involves two different coadopter communities, but external to the coadopter community with a lower coadopter relative advantage that adopts the innovation component. Third, we divide the early-stage diffusion process into four phases—emergence, structuralization, evolution, and chasm—and identify the institutional entrepreneurship strategies used and the OV functions enacted by the IE during each phase. We propose that the IE for a codependent innovation will: (1) use the rationale development strategy and enact the interpretation OV function during the emergence phase, (2) use the resource mobilization strategy and enact the mobilization OV function during the structuralization phase, (3) use the relationship development strategy and enact the legitimation OV function during the evolution phase, and (4) use all the three institutional entrepreneurship strategies and enact all the three OV functions during the chasm phase.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-06T09:27:17Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-08T03:00:35Z", "accepted_date": null}

We instantiate this theory in four supply chain contexts to validate and revise the proposed design in two rounds. We identify six system components data collection, energy monitoring, supply chain coordination, ECMS workflow engine, reporting, and carbon footprint estimator that integrate and coordinate four types of information flows (transactional, contextual, energy, and product environmental), and formulate design principles. Our evaluation indicates that the ECMS design theory, if instantiated, supports energy and carbon measurement and environmentally aware decision-making and practice in supply chains.

However, such sanctions are typically moderate and not career ending. We test the boundary conditions of this theory by evaluating whether neutralization plays a role in overcoming the impact of extreme levels of deterrence. We extend the Siponen and Vance (2010) framework within a professional context that assigns extreme sanctions to violators. Using the scenario-based factorial survey method common in IS security research, we collected data from future auditors who understand these extreme sanctions. We test the reasons that auditors may use to form intentions to falsify information concerning an information security issue with a company’s accounting information system, thereby jeopardizing data integrity and security by modifying working papers to hide irregularities and, by doing so, violating their professional standards, which could result in career-ending sanctions. We empirically validated and tested the theoretical model. Our results show that sanctions play an important role in reducing employees’ intentions to violate policy but that, even under extreme boundary conditions, employees might seek to rationalize their unethical behavior by denying responsibility for their actions through, for example, arguing that their supervisors pressured them into performing the violations. We also establish that messages heightening the awareness and perceptions of the certainty and severity of organizational punishment are likely to attenuate such deviant behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future avenues for research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-10T09:54:42Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:29:09Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, an “uncanny valley” exists in which avatars trigger aversion when they are almost but not quite realistic. We used a field study to investigate whether users had different affinity, trustworthiness, and preferences for avatars with two levels of realism, one that was close to human-realistic and one a cartoon caricature. We observed behavior, conducted one-on-one interviews, and collected survey data from SIGGRAPH conference attendees who either participated in a live discussion session between two avatars in a VR environment, or observed it via 3D VR headsets or on a large screen 2D video display. Eighteen sessions were conducted over four days, with the same person animating the human-realistic avatar and different guests animating the caricature avatars. The guests who interacted with the human-realistic avatar had a positive experience in the VR environment. The observers had positive evaluations of both avatars while acknowledging their different levels of realism. They rated the human-realistic avatar as more trustworthy, had more affinity for it, and preferred it as a virtual agent. Participants who observed the interview through VR headsets had an even stronger affinity for the human-realistic avatar and stronger preferences for it than those who observed via the 2D screen. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. Our results suggest that it is now possible to cross the uncanny valley with human-realistic avatars rendered in real time.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 66, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T16:34:07Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:29:00Z", "accepted_date": null}

Understanding why individuals are willing to engage in open innovation and how their diverse goals affect their participation is important for assessing the viability of various OI models and to inform platform design. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that examines the impact of three categories of human goals extrinsic, intrinsic, and internalized extrinsic on actors continuous intentions to participate in three general categories of open innovation behaviors: ideation, collaboration, and socialization. The model also considers how perceived platform participation affordances mediate the influence of goals on these innovation behaviors. We validate this goals-affordances-behavior model via a field survey of participants on a social product development (SPD) platform.

We further identify five types of boundaries underlying some of the important implicit rules of maintaining privacy: communication channel, platform, device, temporal, and purpose boundaries. Using an online vignette survey, we investigated how each of these boundary types affected users’ privacy perceptions when they were subjected to personalized advertisements. Using fixed- and random-effects models, we investigated how violating different boundary rules leads to changes in perceived privacy. Our results show that all five boundary types are significant predictors of perceived privacy within individuals. The communication channel, device, and business versus private purpose are significant predictors of perceived privacy across the whole sample. Temporal boundaries and platform boundaries failed to achieve statistical significance when evaluated simultaneously with the other factors across the whole sample. This means that for each individual, observing the rules of these five boundary types leads to higher perceived privacy than not observing these conditions. Taken as a whole, observing communication channel, device, and business versus private purpose boundaries also leads to higher averages of perceived privacy across the whole sample.

Because of this emulation, research on CAs is inseparably linked to questions about anthropomorphism—the attribution of human qualities, including consciousness, intentions, and emotions, to nonhuman agents. Past research has demonstrated that anthropomorphism affects human perception and behavior in human-computer interactions by, for example, increasing trust and connectedness or stimulating social response behaviors. Based on the psychological theory of anthropomorphism and related research on computer interface design, we develop a theoretical framework for designing anthropomorphic CAs. We identify three groups of factors that stimulate anthropomorphism: technology design-related factors, task-related factors, and individual factors. Our findings from an online experiment support the derived framework but also reveal novel yet counterintuitive insights. In particular, we demonstrate that not all combinations of anthropomorphic technology design cues increase perceived anthropomorphism. For example, we find that using only nonverbal cues harms anthropomorphism; however, this effect becomes positive when nonverbal cues are complemented with verbal or human identity cues. We also find that CAs’ disposition to complete computerlike versus humanlike tasks and individuals’ disposition to anthropomorphize greatly affect perceived anthropomorphism. This work advances our understanding of anthropomorphism and contextualizes the theory of anthropomorphism within the IS discipline. We advise on the directions that research and practice should take to find the sweet spot for anthropomorphic CA design.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 92, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-02T06:01:40Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:06Z", "accepted_date": null}

Although previous studies have investigated the classical decision-making strategies used in preferential choice problems, most of these are not directly applicable to multiple advice source environments. In addition, since most of these studies have mainly focused on a variance model rather than a process model, they cannot fully explain how decision makers reach their product selection decisions. To shed light on the processes that online consumers use in making product selections when using multiple advice sources, this study: (1) explores if, how, and when consumers use consistency as a part of their decision-making strategies through developing process models; (2) identifies the consistency strategies utilized when using multiple advice sources; and (3) proposes a new consistency-based decision-making model. Through concurrent verbal protocol analysis, we identified four consistency strategies and found that the use of consistency strategies increases decision quality more than traditional nonconsistency strategies.

Drawing on return migration theory, we developed a theory-driven model of SNS resumption that includes two novel antecedents of SNS resumption behavior: nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction. We also hypothesize that dispositional resistance to change moderates the impact of nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction on resumption. We used a mixed methods approach to refine and evaluate the research model. Study 1 used the critical incident method to identify SNS-specific antecedents of nonuse-related satisfaction and use-related satisfaction, allowing us to refine the research model. Study 2 used structural equation modeling to evaluate our research model using two three-wave surveys: one with recent ex-users who recently decided to stop using and delete their profiles on Facebook and one with long-standing ex-users who stopped using and deleted their profiles on Facebook a long time ago. We found support for most relationships in our model: nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction drive resumption intentions, and dispositional resistance moderates these relationships. Furthermore, we found that the time elapsed since users discontinued Facebook moderated these relationships such that the effect of nonuse-related dissatisfaction on resumption intention is stronger for recent ex-users and the effect of use-related satisfaction is stronger for long-standing ex-users. Our findings advance the understanding of resumption, an understudied behavior of the IT lifecycle and IT use and acceptance research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-13T16:00:48Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T13:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T13:03:10Z", "accepted_date": null}

Since EA is a relatively young discipline, a great deal of its work focuses on architecture representations (descriptive EA) that conceptualize the different architecture layers, their components, and relationships. Beyond architecture representations, EA should comprise principles that guide architecture design and evolution toward predefined value and outcomes (prescriptive EA). However, research on EA principles is still very limited. Notwithstanding the increasing consensus regarding the role and definition of EA principles, the limited publications neither discuss what can be considered suitable principles nor explain how they can be turned into effective means to achieve expected EA outcomes. This study seeks to strengthen the extant theoretical core of EA by investigating EA principles through a mixed methods research design comprising a literature review, an expert study, and three case studies. The first contribution of this study is that it sheds light on the ambiguous interpretation of EA principles in the extant research by ontologically distinguishing between principles and nonprinciples, as well as deriving a set of suitable EA (meta)principles. The second contribution connects the nascent academic discourse on EA principles to studies on EA value and outcomes. This study conceptualizes the “mechanics” of EA principles as a value-creation process, where EA principles shape architecture design and guide its evolution and thereby realize EA outcomes. Consequently, this study brings the underserved, prescriptive aspect of EA to the fore and helps enrich its theoretical foundations.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 12, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-24T22:55:06Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:47Z", "accepted_date": null}

But making sense of theoretical diversity requires either a common frame of reference or crystal clarity about concept definitions and the phenomena to which they point. In this editorial, we argue that the IS field still lacks the conceptual and empirical clarity needed to benefit from theoretical diversity about digital transformation. The digital transformation label has been applied to the evolution of technology, as well as to the evolution of organizations and society. It has been used to refer to change in entities or processes and to processes of change. It has been used to refer to particular technological artifacts and to particular kinds of data and processing power. This type of diversity risks obscuring the value of diverse theoretical formulations. Only through clear distinctions and precise labeling of older and new phenomena can the IS field fully benefit from new theories and theoretical elaborations about digital transformation.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 33, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-03T22:23:07Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T16:49:10Z", "accepted_date": null}

We integrate the following theories to formulate our hypotheses: upper echelons theory, agency theory, and information processing theory (in conjunction with strategic management literature). Using a sample of firm-years (2000 to 2010), we find robust support for the proposition that firms with CIOs are associated with reduced opportunistic bias in earnings forecasts. In addition, we find that, as information uncertainty increases, firms with CIOs generate management forecasts less frequently and exhibit a reduction in optimistic forecasting bias. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of how firms with CIOs can influence forecasting outcomes.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-05-12T06:46:27Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:08Z", "accepted_date": null}

Companies must establish new work practices and change the work environment to create new value propositions leveraging digital technologies. Specifically, to maximize their investments in digital transformation while remaining competitive, they must achieve ambidexterity, which is the capability to balance exploration and exploitation flexibly. More and more companies strive to achieve ambidexterity by establishing digital innovation labs (DILs), where employees explore the opportunities afforded through digital technologies and ensure their successful integration into the main organization. This study analyzes data collected from nine DILs, examining how companies utilize them to achieve organizational ambidexterity. Our analysis reveals a nuanced view on the conceptualization of ambidexterity and how it helps in digital transformation: (1) DILs contribute mainly by transferring employees temporarily from the main organization to the DIL and back. Recombining mechanisms of different theoretical forms of ambidexterity addresses typical issues and tensions stemming from leveraging digital technologies in innovation activities. (2) We find that implementing ambidexterity through organizational design features of DILs provides a successful basis for digital transformation by creating innovations that complement companies’ value propositions with digital technologies.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-27T08:20:44Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:51Z", "accepted_date": null}

To date, attempts to mitigate these limitations have had limited success. Accordingly, I consider how developments in artificial intelligence technologies—in particular, pretrained large language models with downstream fine-tuning—might be used to automate peer reviews. I discuss several challenges that are likely to arise if these systems are built and deployed and some ways to address these challenges. If the systems are deemed successful, I describe some characteristics of a highly competitive, lucrative marketplace for these systems that is likely to emerge.

We test our hypotheses using M&amp;A transactions\nfrom 1996 to 2016 and a unique 10-K textual analysis-based measure of product differentiation. Using\nthe difference-in-differences identification strategy, the following findings are supported: (1) M&amp;As lead\nto higher product differentiation, (2) in-house innovation capability and exploitation-oriented innovation\nstrategy positively moderate the positive effect of M&amp;As. These results, which are robust to endogeneities\nand other robustness tests, contribute to theory and managerial practice by shedding light on the role of\nM&amp;As as an essential mechanism for product innovation and the complementary role of in-house\ninnovation capability and strategy for firms that intend to take advantage of M&amp;As for creating a\ncompetitive edge through differentiating their products and services from competitors. These findings\nhave important managerial value, providing an alternative narrative to the current view on M&amp;As in IT\nindustries as a means of absorbing and dismantling the competition.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T16:26:11Z", "created_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:09Z", "deposited_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:19Z", "accepted_date": null}

Prior to this change, guests/hosts could post reviews about their experiences asynchronously, the guest/host would be able to see the other partys review whenever it was posted. In contrast, the new review policy rolled out a simultaneous review system, making reviews viewable only after both the guest/host post their own reviews. This study empirically evaluates the impacts of this new review policy on the informativeness of guest reviews, measured by both informational content (semantic diversity and objectivity) and personal opinions (sentiment and sentiment heterogeneity). Using regression discontinuity design and a variety of techniques in the text analytics domain including a novel adaptation of BERT, we demonstrate that Airbnb review policy change enhanced the informational content of guest reviews in terms of semantic diversity and objectivity. We also show that review sentiment was reduced but became more diverse. Subgroup analysis revealed that low-quality listings were subject to more changes than high-quality listings. We further explore the short-term and long-term effects of the review policy change and demonstrate that the simultaneous review system has had a long-lasting impact on the informativeness of guest reviews.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T20:59:55Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:40Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:52Z", "accepted_date": null}

To study how incumbent companies can govern ecosystem transformations successfully, we interpret ecosystems as organizational fields and ecosystem transformations as changes to the fields’ institutional infrastructure. Based on a multiyear, grounded theory study of the transformation of SAP’s on-premises ERP system, we first identify institutionalization challenges that arise when institutional infrastructure is changed during an ecosystem transformation. We then show how field-level governance mechanisms address these challenges and how the new institutional infrastructure gains legitimacy among ecosystem actors, ultimately leading to the institutionalization of the transformed ecosystem. These findings contribute to the literature on ecosystem transformations and platform governance by highlighting the role that institutional forces play in ecosystem transformations. Furthermore, we add to the literature on institutional theory by providing insights into the dynamics of institutional infrastructure as it becomes infused with digital technologies.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 21, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-13T01:19:48Z", "created_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:42Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, such recommendations are often infeasible and oversimplistic given mounting evidence attesting to users’ growing reliance on technology in both their personal and professional lives. Building on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we construct a research model to explain how mobile application usage, as delineated by its breadth and depth, affects users’ nomophobia and sleep deprivation, which can have negative impacts on users’ health status. We also consider the moderating influence of physical activity in mitigating the effects of mobile application usage on users’ health. We validated our hypotheses via data collected by surveying 5,842 respondents. Empirical findings reveal that (1) nomophobia is positively influenced by mobile application usage breadth but negatively influenced by mobile application usage depth, (2) sleep deprivation is negatively influenced by mobile application usage breadth but positively influenced by mobile application usage depth, and (3) sleep deprivation and nomophobia negatively impact users’ health status, whereas (4) physical activity attenuates the impact of mobile application usage on sleep deprivation but not nomophobia. The findings from this study not only enrich the extant literature on the health outcomes of mobile application usage by unveiling the impact of mobile application usage patterns and physical activity on users’ health but they also inform practitioners on how calibrating usage breadth and depth, along with encouraging physical activity, can promote healthy habits among users.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-03T17:57:27Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T16:49:17Z", "accepted_date": null}

The strengths and weaknesses of different representations are typically assessed by cognitive theories that assume an analytical and an intuitive mode of information processing. Previous research has focused mainly on the analytical risk assessment while intuitive information processing has largely been neglected. We develop a theoretical argument based on dual-process theory, which explains why RIC representational alternatives influence different levels of information processing. We test our hypotheses with the help of an online experiment using accountants and operation managers recruited via MTurk (N = 166). Our results suggest that highlighting risk and controls in business process modeling and notation (BPMN) by using color improves risk understanding, control understanding, and the identification of control improvements, which help reduce the risk in a given process. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that the inclusion of color leads to perception biases. This has implications for information systems research, which has primarily addressed the analytical processing of conceptual models. Our findings extend cognitive research on such models by adding an intuitive processing path that can improve the user’s risk management performance. For practitioners, our findings are particularly relevant because colors can be easily added as a secondary notation element without disguising the factual risk situation in processes.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T20:59:09Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:29:03Z", "accepted_date": null}

This paper is a response to this concern that takes on the challenging task of recognizing innovation in IS research.

BPNs satisfaction is associated with both increased psychological well-being and\ncontinuance, whereas BPNs frustration is negatively associated with both.

Although earlier online word-of-mouth research\nempirically documented that negative reviews influence product sales to a greater extent than\npositive reviews (i.e., a negativity bias), later research has revealed that positive reviews are generally\nmore helpful (i.e., a positivity bias). We propose that an answer to this conundrum may be that\nnegative reviews get more exposure than positive reviews. As consumers are often overwhelmed by\nthe massive number of online reviews, they need to be selective when searching for reviews. This\nresearch investigates consumers’ preference for positive vs. negative reviews during both the\ninformation-seeking and information-evaluation stages of their decision-making process. Drawing\non the motivated reasoning literature, we propose that consumers exhibit a negativity bias when they\nsearch for reviews to read but manifest a confirmation bias when they evaluate the helpfulness of\nreviews. We conducted three experiments and found consistent support for these hypotheses. Our\nfindings expand the current understanding of consumers’ processing of online reviews to the\ninformation-seeking stage, reveal differential biases at different stages, demonstrate a possible\nexplanation for the negativity bias in product sales, and provide important practical implications.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T21:01:12Z", "created_date": "2023-07-11T11:38:09Z", "deposited_date": "2023-07-11T11:38:21Z", "accepted_date": null}

In the organizational behavior literature, research has found that job embeddedness provides direct, positive benefits for employers, including lower turnover intentions, lower levels of withdrawal behaviors, lower actual turnover, and more. In this paper, we present a more nuanced view, namely that embeddedness among IT professionals may influence the development of professionalized mindsets, which, in turn, has a mix of positive and negative consequences. To understand these relationships, we introduce a concept called workgroup embeddedness (WGE). WGE captures how IT professionals become embedded in their organizational workgroup or unit. We report a multiphase study that (1) developed a measure of WGE, (2) established the validity of WGE, and (3) evaluated the implications of WGE among 150 IT professionals using data collected at two points in time. We found that WGE drives an increase in professionalism, which, in turn, increases work-life conflict. Also, we found that both WGE and professionalism positively influence organizational citizenship behaviors. These findings indicate that WGE may play a role in socializing and driving more professionalized mindsets among IT professionals, such as professional identification, which leads to positive outcomes like citizenship behaviors but may come at the expense of negative consequences in professionals’ nonwork lives. Post hoc findings highlight that belief in public service and identification with the IT profession influence work-life conflict and organizational citizenship. We conclude with implications for research and practice.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-05-09T07:30:20Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T16:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-09-09T16:23:17Z", "accepted_date": null}

Yet there is a conundrum in the literature, with some studies suggesting that\ntransparency may benefit group creativity and others suggesting that privacy may do so. A similar\nconundrum exists regarding the effects of different social capital types—structural holes vs. network\ncohesion—on group creativity. Enterprise social media (ESM) provide a unique opportunity to solve these\nconundrums by allowing groups to be “transparent” (non-group members can observe and/or participate\nin group activities) or “private” (group members and activities are hidden from the community) and\nenabling groups to develop distinct social capital structures. Using data from 28,083 written interactions\nproduced by 109 transparent and 106 private groups in an ESM of a multinational design firm, we found\nstrong support for our contingency hypotheses that both transparent and private groups may produce high\nlevels of creative dialogues, yet in different forms. Specifically, expansion-focused creative dialogues—\nthose focused on combining or expanding existing concepts—emerge in transparent groups, but only\nwhen the group’s social capital is characterized by structural holes. Conversely, we found that reframingfocused dialogues—those focused on challenging and rethinking—emerge in private groups but only\nwhen the group’s social capital is characterized by network cohesion. Theoretically, these findings can\nhelp to solve the conundrums in the literature on group creativity and shed light on the role of ESM use\nin this context. Practically, our findings offer a critical reflection o contemporary initiatives for increasing\ntransparency, whether through physical design or digital transformation.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T17:20:58Z", "created_date": "2023-05-10T21:29:49Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-08T01:31:11Z", "accepted_date": null}

To better understand this paradox at a more granular level, we conceptualize the sensing and responding dimensions of organizational agility as two independent constructs and suggest a nonlinear analytical approach. Based on configurational and contextual perspectives, this study investigates how intellectual and social alignment and organizational and environmental elements combine into multiple configurations to affect sensing and responding capabilities. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to analyze the survey data from 135 dyads of business and IT executives from the Chinese shipbuilding industry. Results show that different equifinal pathways can be used to achieve high sensing and responding capabilities, in which intellectual and social alignment play heterogeneous roles depending on the specific contexts. This study extends the ITenabled agility literature by deepening our understanding of the effects of multidimensional IT alignment on multidimensional organizational agility and providing new insights into the IT alignment-agility paradox.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 10, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T15:24:43Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T16:49:18Z", "accepted_date": null}

To account for this phenomenon, it is imperative to develop a theoretical understanding of\nits processes and objects.

We theorize digital transformation as\na progressive replacement of humans by digital technologies in performing an organization’s\nfundamental activities underpinning the processes of scanning, interpretation, and learning that\nencompass an organization’s interaction with its environment. As a result, organizations cease to be\nhuman interpretation systems and instead turn into digital enactment systems, where digital\ntechnologies, instead of humans, nearly autonomously create and act upon information. We illustrate\nthis digital transformation theory using the example of high-frequency trading. This transformation\nredefines the relationship among organizations, information, and the environment, changing the role\nof humans and reshaping strategic decision-making. Thus conceived, digital transformation offers a\nconcrete way of theorizing and accounts for deep implications on the nature of organizations and\norganizing in the digital age.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T15:22:34Z", "created_date": "2023-11-06T01:22:40Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T14:52:52Z", "accepted_date": null}

In these campaigns, participants are required to collect a specific amount of help from their social network in exchange for attractive rewards. Participants often face challengesin obtaining positive feedback from their social networking groups due to the diffusion of responsibility. Based on the triangle model of responsibility, this study proposes and empirically tests a research model that examines two key determinants (i.e., request personalization and relational closeness) of recipients’ perceived responsibility that further shape their responses to HRR. Our field experiment empirically supports the research hypotheses. Overall, this study enriches the literature on online social referrals by focusing on HRR, where social referrals are broadcasted and senders reap referral benefits.

We examine how the positioning of IT-producing firms within their networks of strategic alliances moderates profits from R&amp;D investments. We posit that alliances with IT-consuming firms generate relation-specific rents that, in turn, protect the value of R&amp;D investments by making software innovations difficult for rivals to appropriate. Among IT-producing firms, we make a distinction between software consulting and services firms and software package-product firms. Our analyses of 464 IT-producing firms for the 14-year period 1996-2009 suggest that IT-producing firms’ returns on R&amp;D investments increase with alliance ties to IT-consuming firms. We also find that alliances with IT-consuming firms have a more beneficial effect on R&amp;D investment returns for software consulting and services firms than for software package-product firms. Our findings yield nuanced insights into how IT-producing firms should position themselves within a network of alliances with IT-consuming firms. We discuss implications for research and practice.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 9, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-03T10:17:11Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T00:01:22Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-07T12:36:13Z", "accepted_date": null}

This is important because of their role in influencing human decisions, which then generate new data points for training. For instance, if an ML prediction results in the rejection of a loan application, the bank forgoes the opportunity to record the applicant’s actual creditworthiness, thereby impacting the availability of this data point for future model updates and potentially affecting the model’s performance. This paper delves into the relationship between the continuous updating of ML models and algorithmic discrimination in environments where predictions endogenously influence the creation of new training data. Using comprehensive simulations based on secondary empirical data, we examine the dynamic evolution of an ML model’s fairness and economic consequences in a setting that mirrors sequential interactions, such as loan approval decisions. Our findings indicate that continuous updating can help mitigate algorithmic discrimination and enhance economic efficiency over time. Importantly, we provide evidence that human decision makers in the loop who possess the authority to override ML predictions may impede the self-correction of discriminatory models and even induce initially unbiased models to become discriminatory with time. These findings underscore the complex sociotechnological nature of algorithmic discrimination and highlight the role that humans play in addressing it when ML models undergo continuous updating. Our results have important practical implications, especially considering the impending regulations mandating human involvement in ML-supported decision-making processes.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-26T07:06:20Z", "created_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:53Z", "deposited_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:54Z", "accepted_date": null}

The market success of SPAs is largely based on their innovative material properties, such as natural language user interfaces, machine learning-powered request handling and service provision, and anthropomorphism. In different combinations, these properties offer users entirely new ways to intuitively and interactively achieve their goals and thus co-create value with service providers. But how does the nature of the SPA shape value co-creation processes? In this paper, we look through a functional affordances lens to theorize about the effects of different types of SPAs (i.e., with different combinations of material properties) on users’ value co-creation processes. Specifically, we collected SPAs from research and practice by reviewing scientific literature and web resources, developed a taxonomy of SPAs’ material properties, and performed a cluster analysis to group SPAs of a similar nature. We then derived 2 general and 11 cluster-specific propositions on how different material properties of SPAs can yield different affordances for value co-creation. With our work, we point out that smart services require researchers and practitioners to fundamentally rethink value co-creation as well as revise affordances theory to address the dynamic nature of smart technology as a service counterpart.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 41, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T16:20:33Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T04:01:22Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-07T17:36:14Z", "accepted_date": null}

Based on self-categorization theory, this study proposes that IT employees’ turnover may be mitigated by fostering their identification with non-IT organizations, which can be done by meeting various facilitative conditions. Guided by intergroup contact theory, we identify IT employees’ perceived alignment between IT and the core business of an organization (business-IT alignment), the extent of boundary-spanning activities that IT employees engage in, and the closeness of the relationships between IT and non-IT employees as the drivers of their organizational identification. Using survey data collected from organizations in different industries, we obtained empirical evidence supporting the positive effects of the perceived business-IT alignment, the extent of boundary-spanning activities, and the relationship closeness between IT and non-IT employees on IT employees’ organizational identification. Additionally, there was a three-way interaction effect among the three drivers such that the relationship closeness between IT and non-IT employees reduced the positive effect of the extent of boundary-spanning activities on IT employees’ organizational identification when business-IT alignment was low. However, this negative moderating effect diminished when business-IT alignment increased.

Given its broad impacts across a variety of areas, smart technologies currently represent one of the hottest topics in both academia and industry. This special issue seeks to identify the latest trends and research directions on this topic by presenting research on the development, evaluation, management, and organization of smart technologies in the age of smart services. We identify three trending categories of smart services: (1) the Internet of Things and wearable technologies, (2) the sharing economy and platforms, and (3) intelligent agents. These innovative technologies and their corresponding production possibilities are of great interest to both researchers and practitioners, particularly in terms of their impacts under different application scenarios. This special issue offers a comprehensive review of IT-enabled smart services and we hope that it motivates further IS research on the theoretical and practical implications of this topic.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 16, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-18T05:13:16Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:58Z", "accepted_date": null}

While the extant literature offers important empirical and theoretical insights into digital transformation in individual organizations, we know little about how adopting organizations within an organizational field react differently over time to the same digital transformation initiative. This is unfortunate, as such insights could help scholars and managers understand option repertoires and constraints in handling digital transformation ideas that travel into organizations. Against this backdrop, we had access to a unique case over an eighteen-year period, which shows how organizations within the Danish home care field reacted differently to a nationwide digital transformation initiative on mobile technology use. To analyze this case, we applied virus theory as a promising perspective for examining how and why the same digital technology and transformation idea occasions different reactions in similar contexts. Our analysis highlights the emerging, fluctuating, and consequential nature of digital transformation within the Danish home care field, which has led to very different reactions across adopting organizations. Drawing on this analysis, we contribute to the expanding literature on digital transformation by providing theoretical and practical knowledge about variations regarding how organizations within an organizational field react over time to digital transformation ideas.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 16, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-09T20:43:12Z", "created_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:18Z", "accepted_date": null}

To obtain guidance to design the knowledge commons, we\ncritically reviewed commons design principles (DPs) that were based on a well-established\neconomics theory. We observed that the commons DPs had significant gaps when applied to IS\npractice. Hence, we developed an alternate set of DPs that we refer to as platform-enabled knowledge\ncommons (PEKC) DPs that are relevant to IS practice. This paper discusses the development of\nPEKC DPs and applies them in instantiating an IS artifact, Service-Symphony. Service-Symphony is\na purpose-built, public-facing knowledge repository developed for the benefit of ITSM practitioners\nand students. Our research followed the design science research (DSR) paradigm and contributes to\nthe body of knowledge by establishing a multigrounded design theory comprising meta-requirements\nand DPs. To bridge theory and practice, we assessed the reusability of PEKC DPs through focus\ngroup interviews with IS architects.

Despite this notable recent investment, questions of whether and why SMT adoption facilitates the reduction of households’ energy demands remain relatively unexplored. Building on cognitive dissonance theory, we propose a research model for SMT adoption, residential energy-saving behaviors, and moderating factors. We then empirically test the model using a rich household dataset from the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that SMT adoption is positively associated with energy-saving behaviors, while energysaving motivations substantially moderate this association—a lower level of concern about saving energy / a higher level of concern about climate change amplifies this effect. Importantly, we find that SMT usage positively moderates this relationship, but this marginal gain decreases in technology usage intensity. Our findings contribute to the information systems literature by showing a consequence of new technology adoption along with the role of cognitive dissonance in promoting intended objectives and identifying potential moderating effects.

Prior research on agility in this context has advanced our knowledge on managerial and employee behaviors, as well as structures supporting such behaviors, to enable agility both in traditional and software firms. The challenge for firms in digitally converging markets is that agility now requires a combination of organizational and IS development agility—perceiving these concepts as separate entities is no longer appropriate or instructive. Building on prior work on agile behaviors and structures, and published cases on digital firms, we develop an integrative conception of digital agility in line with the realities of the digital era.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 41, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-28T20:24:59Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:08Z", "accepted_date": null}

We experiment with GPT-4 in the role of a reviewer to demonstrate the opportunities and the risks we experience and ways to mitigate them. The reviews are structured according to a conference review form with the dual purpose of evaluating submissions for editorial decisions and providing authors with constructive feedback according to predefined criteria, which include contribution, soundness, and presentation. We demonstrate feasibility by evaluating and comparing LLM reviews with human reviews, concluding that current AI-augmented reviewing is sufficiently accurate to alleviate the burden of reviewing but not completely and not for all cases. We then enumerate the opportunities of AI-augmented reviewing and present open questions. Next, we identify the risks of AI-augmented reviewing, highlighting bias, value misalignment, and misuse.

What drives this technology anthropomorphism (TA), or the attribution of humanlike characteristics to IT? What is it about users, IT, and their interactions that influences the extent to which people think of technology as humanlike? While TA can have positive effects, such as increasing user trust in technology, what are the negative consequences of TA? To provide a framework for addressing these questions, we advance a theory of TA that integrates the general three-factor anthropomorphism theory in social and cognitive psychology with the needs-affordances-features perspective from the information systems (IS) literature. The theory we construct helps to explain and predict which technological features and affordances are likely: (1) to satisfy users’ psychological needs, and (2) to lead to TA. More importantly, we problematize some negative consequences of TA. Technology features and affordances contributing to TA can intensify users’ anchoring with their elicited agent knowledge and psychological needs and also can weaken the adjustment process in TA under cognitive load. The intensified anchoring and weakened adjustment processes increase egocentric biases that lead to negative consequences. Finally, we propose a research agenda for TA and egocentric biases.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-20T18:54:40Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T13:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T13:24:50Z", "accepted_date": null}

We discuss the differentiated effects that AI brings about and the implications for future IS research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 149, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-04T08:04:51Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T00:01:22Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-07T12:36:09Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, empirical findings based on PMT are often inconsistent and inconclusive. To reconcile these inconsistent findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationships among PMT constructs while also considering additional contextual constructs that are not specified in PMT. Ninety-two published studies were meta-analyzed and estimated using structural equation modeling. Our results provide support for three of the five predictors of security motivation intention, as postulated by PMT, mixed support for perceived vulnerability, and no support for response cost. We found that coping appraisal variables of response efficacy and self-efficacy have the largest average effects on security behavior. In addition, cultural attributes of collectivism and individualism moderated some of the pairwise correlations, PMT-theoretic relationships were generally stronger in personal contexts than in workplace contexts, and the intention-behavior relationship was strongest in workplace and compliance settings. Our results contribute to the information security literature by providing guidance for future PMT-related research and by demonstrating how meta-analysis and structural equation modeling can be combined to test theories in information systems research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 47, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-04T08:16:52Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:40Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:49Z", "accepted_date": null}

Their bidding strategies hinge on understanding who competes with whom, how they compete, and how consumers react to competing advertisements. In this context, we investigate how firm competition impacts consumers’ click-through behaviors in search advertising from a strategic group perspective. Using search results from Google and consumers’ clickstream data, we found strong negative externality for competitors within the same strategic group relative to competitors across strategic groups: firms reap fewer click-throughs when an advertisement of another firm from the same strategic group is also displayed in search results, relative to when other displayed advertisers are not from the same group. This indicates that when competitors from the same strategic group are likely to appear in the results of a sponsored search auction, the focal firm would be better off avoiding head-to-head competition in the auction. However, we did not find empirical evidence of such firm behaviors, suggesting myopia or the inability of firms to avoid such competition. We also show that when multiple firms from the same strategic group appear in search results, the closer the focal firm is located to such competing firms, the more click-throughs the firm accrues. This suggests that firms should stay close to their within-group competitors when they compete in the same search auction. Further, our empirical results indicate that firms are indeed doing so. Using another set of data from Google AdWords reports, we show that our findings are also robust to multi-keyword bidding scenarios. These findings represent the first attempt to understand the impact of strategic groups in search advertising and provide interesting implications for advertisers and search engines.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-09-11T15:39:11Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:50:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:50:44Z", "accepted_date": null}

Only 17% of a projected 3.5 million computing job openings are expected to be filled by 2026 (National Association for Women &amp; Information Technology, 2018). Yet the number of women pursuing IT careers continues to decrease—only 19% of IT bachelor’s degrees in 2016 were awarded to women compared to 57% of bachelor’s degrees overall. We compared three theories that could explain this gender gap in the pursuit of IT careers: expectancy-value theory, role congruity theory, and field-specific ability beliefs theory. We find that women and men are similar in their levels of important factors related to career interest, but that two of these factors—technical learning self-efficacy and agentic goals—have increased salience for women. This suggests that some of the gender gap in the IT field could be addressed by placing more focus on developing technical learning self-efficacy in both men and women. While this could help both women and men, it would likely have an outsized effect on the IT career pursuit of women.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-28T20:44:40Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:13Z", "accepted_date": null}

We examine how GenAI impact the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and application, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges this technology presents. In knowledge creation, GenAI enhances information? processing and cognitive functions, fostering individual and organizational learning. However, it also introduces risks like AI bias and reduced human socialization, potentially marginalizing junior knowledge workers. For knowledge storage and retrieval, GenAI’s ability to quickly access vast knowledge bases significantly changes employee interactions with KM systems. This raises questions about balancing human-derived tacit knowledge with AI-generated explicit knowledge. The paper also explores GenAI’s role in knowledge transfer, particularly in training and cultivating a learning culture. Challenges include an over-reliance on AI and risks in disseminating sensitive information. In terms of knowledge application, GenAI is seen as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, but issues like knowledge misapplication, intellectual property, and ethical considerations are critical. Conclusively, the paper argues for a balanced approach to integrating GenAI into KM processes. It advocates for harmonizing GenAI’s capabilities with human insights to effectively manage knowledge in contemporary organizations, ensuring both technological advances and ethical responsibility.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 61, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-04T12:25:53Z", "created_date": "2024-01-02T21:51:06Z", "deposited_date": "2024-01-02T21:51:14Z", "accepted_date": null}

Although cybersecurity personnel may view tactics such as fake phishing attacks and email scanning as protective measures, employees may view them as threats because being singled out as a security risk can harm their standing in the organization. To understand the implications of vulnerability assessments, we examine how organizations’ use of different tactics to identify user vulnerabilities can lead employees to feel betrayed by the cybersecurity unit, resulting in negative cybersecurity outcomes. Drawing on the theory of betrayal aversion, we develop a model that shows that when employees perceive these tactics as harmful, they can lead to an affective state of cybersecurity betrayal, resulting in a damaged relationship with the cybersecurity unit. In collaboration with an organization’s cybersecurity unit, we evaluated our model using an experimental vignette survey, post hoc interviews, and a crosssectional survey with two samples (i.e., employees in the organization and employees from a panel). We found that when organizations conduct vulnerability assessments to enhance cybersecurity, they often induce an affective state of betrayal and increase employees’ active resistance to cybersecurity (i.e., abandonment, avoidance, and sabotage of cybersecurity policies, technologies, and units). The paper concludes with implications for research and practice that explain the unintended consequences of vulnerability assessment and betrayal.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T14:19:18Z", "created_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:53Z", "deposited_date": "2024-07-06T08:51:04Z", "accepted_date": null}

Research suggests that IT-enabled supply chain information integration (IT-SCII) helps firms collaborate with suppliers and clients in broad business activities, operate in a unique context, and overcome salient challenges in BOP markets. Anecdotal evidence and research suggest that foreign and domestic firms have differing advantages: While foreign firms have considerable global experience, domestic firms have substantial local market knowledge. We draw on the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework to theorize that domestic and foreign firms leverage IT-SCII differently because of their differing ownership-based advantages in BOP markets. We hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on client business collaboration and the influence of client business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for domestic firms than for foreign firms. Conversely, we hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on supplier business collaboration and the influence of supplier business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for foreign firms than for domestic firms. We test our hypotheses in the automotive parts manufacturing BOP market comprising foreign and domestic firms in India. Partial least squares and econometric analyses of 172 firms reveal broad support for our hypotheses. By incorporating the OLI framework into IT-enabled supply chain literature, our study contributes to theory and practice by highlighting that IT-SCII has differing implications for foreign and domestic firms in BOP markets.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 15, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-03T09:32:45Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:29:04Z", "accepted_date": null}

Whether organizations can actualize the benefits of new technology depends critically on how end users evaluate and cope with it. Various intervention practices have been proven to be effective in facilitating user adaptation in the existing literature. However, research that systematically examines the impacts of intervention practices across implementation stages and usage contexts is still rare. Leveraging coping theory, we propose a 2×2 framework under the conditions of pre-/post-implementation stages and mandatory/voluntary usage contexts to investigate how various intervention practices adjust user appraisals of new technology via different coping mechanisms. We then extend the investigation into the downstream job outcomes and make comparisons of relevant relationships across usage contexts. Our empirical findings from two unique organizational settings, featured opposite degrees of usage voluntariness, support consistently significant effects of intervention practices, beliefs updating, and effects of usage behavior on job outcomes in both contexts while suggesting nuanced differences between the two contexts. Our research sheds light on how to manage technology implementations and help users cope with the change effectively in different contexts via various intervention practices in the technology implementation process.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-08T06:03:42Z", "created_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:53Z", "deposited_date": "2024-07-06T08:51:01Z", "accepted_date": null}

The present study uses political skill as a theorizing lens to investigate how microtask workers utilize the capabilities of these communities that influence their ability to avoid financial marginalization. Using pseudo-ethnography and thematic analysis, we employed a sequential mixed methods design to identify how community capabilities and ideological beliefs influence worker performance. These insights then informed the design of an empirical study using survey data from 253 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who use microtasking communities to test our research model. We found that politically skilled individuals use community capabilities, subsequently influencing their hourly wage.

Clients can address this challenge by combining bilateral governance focused on each vendor’s individual performance with collective governance aimed at the vendors’ joint performance. However, it is unclear how the simultaneous application of bilateral and collective governance affects multisourcing performance. Indeed, the literature falls short in systematically differentiating these governance mechanisms and empirically examining their interplay. Drawing on existing work on multisourcing and on the outsourcing governance literature, we argue that bilateral and collective governance direct efforts toward different performance dimensions (individual vs. joint), invoke different metaphors (market vs. team), and promote conflicting norms (competitive vs. cooperative), which can result in trade-offs when bilateral and collective governance mechanisms are combined. Results from a survey of 189 multisourcing arrangements support our expectation that bilateral and collective governance promote different performance dimensions. Notably, one collective governance mechanism, conflict management procedures, contributes to both individual and joint performance. We find substitutional effects between bilateral and collective governance in relation to joint performance but not individual performance, indicating that the benefits of collective governance for joint performance are more easily compromised than the benefits of bilateral governance for individual performance. We also observe complementary effects within collective governance mechanisms. Our key contribution lies in theorizing and empirically examining the effects and interplay of bilateral and collective governance in multisourcing.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T21:00:26Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T16:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-09-09T16:23:12Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, this issue has not received much attention in the information systems (IS) research community. Guided by dual-system theory, we theoretically derive a typology of obsessive technology use and contextually adapt it to conceptualize obsessive online social gaming. We also build upon identity theory to develop a dual-identity perspective (i.e., IT identity and social identity) of obsessive online social gaming. We test our research model using a longitudinal survey of 627 online social game users. Our results demonstrate that the typology of obsessive technology use comprises four interrelated types: impulsive use, compulsive use, excessive use, and addictive use. IT identity positively affects the four obsessive online social gaming archetypes and fully mediates the effect of social identity on obsessive online social gaming. The results also show that IT identity is predicted by embeddedness, self-efficacy, and instant gratification, whereas social identity is determined by group similarity, group familiarity, and intragroup communication. Our study contributes to the IS literature by proposing a typology of obsessive technology use, incorporating identity theory to provide a contextualized explanation of obsessive online social gaming and offering implications for addressing the societal challenge.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 28, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-24T08:17:49Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:43Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, this model was developed for industrial-age material technologies and does not address digital technologies with nonmaterial elements. Therefore, a question emerges as to whether the level of technological materiality is implicated in different dynamics of innovation, as reflected in the technology lifecycle. Digital technologies evolve through discourse that involves interactions among multiple stakeholders that shape the evolutionary trajectory of the technology. Therefore, we set out to examine whether discourse about digital technologies that vary in their level of materiality manifests in different ways throughout these technologies’ lifecycles. To do so, we conducted a study comparing the discourse around 10 digital technologies—five highly material and five highly nonmaterial—at different stages of their technology lifecycles. We identified three characteristics of discourse—volume, volatility, and diversity—and examined them for the 10 digital technologies by analyzing their corresponding Wikipedia articles. Our findings show that the discourse around technologies with different levels of materiality is similar in the initial era of the lifecycle but diverges in the two subsequent eras. In addition, we found that the discourse around highly nonmaterial technologies remains elevated for longer time periods, compared to highly material technologies. Based on these results, we put forth propositions that challenge and extend existing research on the relationships between the technological level of materiality, discourse, and trajectories of technology evolution.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-08T05:48:40Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:09Z", "accepted_date": null}

This study considers two app developers with substitutable apps and a continuum of consumers with heterogeneous preferences. Each developer decides between offering a paid app and offering a free basic app with in-app purchases. Because of product fit uncertainty, consumers are not sure about the degree of misfit between the app and their preferences, and that uncertainty can be reduced by trying the free basic app. Using a game-theoretic modeling framework, we analyze how product fit uncertainty affects competing developers’ profits and examine the scenario in which each developer offers a paid app or a free basic app with in-app purchases in a duopoly setting. The analytical results suggest that the developer can offer a free basic app for consumer learning even if the app is not underestimated. When either developer offers a free trial, the developer with the higher-quality app will prefer higher product fit uncertainty, but the one with the lower-quality app will favor lower product fit uncertainty. Additionally, as the app quality increases or consumer preferences become stronger, developers may switch the strategy depending on the reduction in product fit uncertainty caused by the free trial. Our study establishes the usefulness of the freemium strategy beyond the contexts analyzed in the literature. The results explain empirical observations of the app market and provide recommendations about the information disclosure of fit attributes in a competitive market.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-06-24T02:47:39Z", "created_date": "2022-11-04T20:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-04T20:50:45Z", "accepted_date": null}

In responding to these issues, we develop an accessible “power-sensitive” framework, using the episodic/systemic view of power and an activity theory (AT) view of organizational practices. We draw on two cases of IS work. Case 1 focuses on information technology (IT) organizations in Bulgaria, and Case 2 focuses on a global development sector nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Thailand. While much of the IS literature emphasizes cutting-edge innovations, this paper highlights mundane yet widespread IS applications such as email and spreadsheets. We elaborate on lessons learned from the cases and develop a power-sensitive framework to support IS researchers and practitioners seeking to acknowledge power in different IS contexts. The paper has two main aims and contributions: to illustrate how power can be articulated using the episodic/systemic view and AT by providing a more dynamic perspective that goes beyond traditional views of power as possessive, hierarchical, and static, and to deploy the cases strategically as part of a broader call for more consideration of power in IS research, illustrating the important insights such a focus can provide. We argue against simply ignoring power or considering it as a “nuisance” in IS research. Instead, we argue that power is endemic to IS work and an integral aspect of everyday IS practices.

Many studies are doing an admirable job of integrating two-level models into their examination of IS phenomena. However, two-level models are limited in how well they enable researchers to (1) more explicitly incorporate context into theory development and testing and (2) bridge the existing gap between micro- and macrolevel research by focusing on intervening mechanisms that link hierarchically distal levels of analysis. Three-level models have emerged as a potential way to address these limitations. While the literature has clearly outlined the mechanics of how to estimate three-level models, there is very little, if any, guidance on when and how to integrate the use of such models with theory development. Consequently, IS researchers have little guidance to inform their decisions about integrating the use of three-level models with their theory development and testing. In this article, we identify the circumstances under which IS researchers should consider the use of three-level models, develop guidelines about how to map the use of three-level model estimation to the theoretical objectives, and provide an illustration of how to implement the guidelines.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-04T12:31:55Z", "created_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:15Z", "deposited_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:20Z", "accepted_date": null}

CAs are used in contexts such as peoples private lives, education, and healthcare, as well as in organizations to innovate or automate tasks for example, in marketing, sales, or customer service. In addition to these application contexts, CAs take on different forms in terms of their embodiment, the communication mode, and their (often human-like) design. Despite their popularity, many CAs are unable to fulfill expectations, and fostering a positive user experience is challenging. To better understand how CAs can be designed to fulfill their intended purpose and how humans interact with them, a number of studies focusing on human-computer interaction have been carried out in recent years, which have contributed to our understanding of this technology. However, currently, a structured overview of this research is lacking, thus impeding the systematic identification of research gaps and knowledge on which future studies can build. To address this issue, we conducted an organizing and assessing review of 262 studies, applying a sociotechnical lens to analyze CA research regarding user interaction, context, agent design, as well as CA perceptions and outcomes. This study contributes an overview of the status quo of CA research, identifies four research streams through cluster analysis, and proposes a research agenda comprising six avenues and sixteen directions to move the field forward</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 166, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-05T19:56:49Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:40Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:45Z", "accepted_date": null}

With the aim of reducing SNS addition, this study investigates the role of SNS characteristics in the formation of SNS addiction. By applying incentive sensitization theory in the context of SNS addiction, we suggest that the compulsive motivation for using an SNS is developed by pleasurable and rewarding SNS use experiences. Social network characteristics and communication characteristics, which determine the rewards that users obtain from SNS use, moderate the relationship between habitual SNS use and SNS addiction. We develop novel behavioral measures of habitual SNS use and SNS addiction based on SNS activity logs and empirically test the research model using a large and unique dataset. Besides contributing to the theoretical development of SNS addiction, the results of this study offer practical options to help prevent SNS addiction. Moreover, the measures of SNS addiction enable the automated monitoring of user behavior on SNS, which could be useful for detecting potential SNS addicts.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-03-19T13:06:26Z", "created_date": "2022-05-10T11:36:32Z", "deposited_date": "2022-05-10T23:40:08Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, they face the challenge of crossing the knowledge divide between analytics groups and business groups. Exploring relationships between the two groups in 37 data-driven organizational initiatives, we develop a configuration-based model that explains analytics and businessdomain knowledge integration through the lens of synergy. Our configurational analyses revealed five configurations of relationships between the two, which bring about two distinct change outcomes: “dedicated data groups” and “multidisciplinary teams” lead to the emergence of new datadriven ways to work, and “analytics institutionalization,” “analytics resource optimization,” and “networked communities” produce convergence, through the sharing of data-driven ways to work. Each configuration displays a distinct element of the core processes identified (“developing group connectedness,” “exchanging analytics and business domain knowledge,” and “incentivizing organizational data use”) and yields either an emergence or convergence of data-driven ways of working. The findings demonstrate how data-driven organizational initiatives can benefit from a pervasive form of organizing that entwines analytics groups and business groups such that their members’ tools, mindsets, and behaviors are merged to profoundly change ways of working. Together, these findings and the configurational methodology used provide a nuanced picture of how organizations integrate the requisite specialist knowledge across domains to realize value from data.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-09-19T16:28:18Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T16:49:21Z", "accepted_date": null}

One way of doing this is to offer free product samples to consumers to incentivize product reviews, displaying them along with a disclosure in the existing pool of organic reviews in the hopes of stimulating sales. However, it is not clear whether such product sampling reviews are indeed beneficial to sales, considering that they may have a nontrivial influence on the generation of organic reviews. Based on data from a leading e-commerce platform in China, we found that sponsored product sampling reviews promoted product sales but also reduced the volume of organic reviews for the targeted product. However, the net effect on sales remained positive, suggesting that e-tailers may wish to utilize sponsored product sampling reviews. We also conducted a scenario-based experiment to reveal how the nature of product sampling reviews affects consumers’ brand quality and fairness perceptions.

Such a conclusion is ironic because the theory has not been sufficiently and suitably replicated. It is possible that misspecifications in the various replications, applications, and extensions have led to the incorrect conclusion that UTAUT is more robust than it really is, leaving limited opportunities for future work. Although work on UTAUT has included important variables, predictors, and moderators, absent a faithful use of the original specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature of the effects of the original and additional variables. The present meta-analysis uses 25,619 effect sizes reported by 737,112 users in 1,935 independent samples to address this issue. Consequently, we develop a clear current state-of-the-art and revised UTAUT that extends the original theory with new endogenous mechanisms from different, other theories (i.e., technology compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, and costs of technology) and new moderating mechanisms to examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different contexts (e.g., technology type and national culture). Based on this revised UTAUT, we present a research agenda that can guide future research on the topic of technology adoption in general and UTAUT in particular.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 130, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-05T22:20:31Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T20:15:40Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T20:15:43Z", "accepted_date": null}

While structured information plays a key role in enabling both decision-making and task execution, we find that physician-created semistructured information is also an important predictor of both efficiency and quality gains. We show that the structure of activity systems (task interdependencies) has a strong moderating influence on the factors that drive efficiency and quality gains.

Environmental dynamism threatens the efficacy of current operations, requiring firms to evolve their processes. Firms’ IT infrastructure may catalyze or hinder their endeavors and performance as they respond to environmental dynamics. Little previous research has examined which IT infrastructure types are high-performing and whether their effects vary across environments. We investigate the impacts of IT infrastructure, examining microlevel implementation—the constitution of technical and human assets—across the establishments of a multi-establishment firm (MEF). Specifically, we use the notion of a dominant IT infrastructure to unravel the heterogeneity of IT infrastructure across establishments. We explore dominant IT infrastructures—technology, human, or both—and assess their impacts across environmental conditions. To test our hypotheses, we used a panel dataset from 2007 to 2009 comprising 355 unique firms. Our findings reveal that the impact of establishment-level IT infrastructure types on MEF performance is contingent on environmental dynamism. A technology-dominant IT infrastructure leads to greater MEF performance in less dynamic environments, while a human-dominant IT infrastructure leads to greater MEF performance in more dynamic environments. The MEF performance is enhanced through a combination of technology- and human-dominant IT infrastructures in more dynamic environments. We conclude by discussing the theoretical insights and managerial implications of our findings.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-06-07T19:28:23Z", "created_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:50Z", "accepted_date": null}

Drawing on feelings-as-information theory, this study investigates the impacts of two types of gesture-based interaction (i.e., touchscreen interaction and mid-air interaction) on consumers’ sense of touch. Results from a laboratory experiment showed that touchscreen interaction elicited a higher sense of touch than mid-air interaction when the importance of product haptic information was high. However, touchscreen interaction did not differ from mid-air interaction in terms of eliciting consumers’ sense of touch when the importance of product haptic information was low. Furthermore, consumers’ sense of touch improved their shopping experience satisfaction by reducing uncertainty about products and fostering attachment to products. Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing literature by empirically investigating the effects of gesture-based interaction on consumers’ bodily sensations, elucidating the role of the sense of touch in affecting consumers’ virtual product experience, and highlighting the impact of the interaction method on consumer behavior. This study also provides practical insights into the application of gesture-based interaction technologies.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-25T10:49:18Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:50:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:50:46Z", "accepted_date": null}

Biased ratings can lead to violations of\ncustomer trust and failures of business intelligence. Hence, both practitioners and researchers have\ndirected massive efforts toward curbing rating biases. In this paper, we investigate bandwagon bias, the\nrating distortion resulting from individuals posting ratings shifted toward the displayed average rating,\nand propose a bias warning approach to mitigate this bias. Drawing on the flexible correction model,\nthe theory of valuation in behavioral economics, and previous warning research, we design an effective\nwarning strategy in two steps. First, we start with the risk-alert warning strategy, which prior research\nhas widely employed, and rationalize its deficiencies by synthesizing theoretical analysis and extant\nempirical evidence. Second, considering the deficiencies, we identify a supplementary content design\nfactor—the ranking task—and construct a risk-alert-with-ranking-task warning strategy. We then\nempirically test the effects of the two warning strategies on individual ratings in cases in which\nbandwagon bias either occurs or does not occur in individuals’ initial assessments. The results of four\ncontrolled experiments indicate that (1) the risk-alert strategy can reduce bandwagon bias in individual\nratings but will elicit unwanted rating distortions when bandwagon bias does not occur in individuals’\ninitial assessments, and (2) the risk-alert-with-ranking-task strategy can mitigate bandwagon bias while\navoiding the unwanted rating distortions above and can thus function as an effective warning strategy.\nOur research contributes to the literature by proposing an effective debiasing solution for bandwagon\nbias and a bias warning approach for online rating debiasing, which can help increase rating\ninformativeness on online platforms.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-27T21:55:48Z", "created_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:09Z", "deposited_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:20Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, despite more than a decade of research on fear appeals in security contexts, researchers have yet to understand which factors drive users’ responses to fear appeals. Instead, the literature is riddled with inconsistent findings on the antecedents that predict fear-appeal outcomes, fueling controversy and inhibiting progress on the problem. This research addresses the inconsistent findings by using construal level theory (CLT) to explain how temporal distance and argument nature affect fear-appeal appraisal. Based on two online experiments, we report evidence showing that temporal distance determines which antecedents drive fear-appeal outcomes, which helps explain inconsistent results found in prior literature. Moreover, we found that depending on the temporal distance condition, argument nature (i.e., “how” or “why” arguments) can impact the effectiveness of fear appeals. Overall, our findings refine the understanding of when certain factors influence users’ responses to fear appeals and provide guidance for future research on how to create more effective fear appeals.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 8, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-23T13:01:15Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:49Z", "accepted_date": null}

But this process has grown long in the tooth and is increasingly frustrating and challenging its various stakeholders: editors, reviewers, and authors. The sudden and explosive spread of AI tools, including advances in language models, make them a tempting fit in our efforts to ease and advance the editorial process. But we must carefully consider how the goals and methods of AI tools fit with the core purpose of the editorial process. We present a thought experiment exploring the implications of two distinct futures for the information systems powering today’s journal editorial process: an AI-augmented and an AI-driven one. The AI-augmented scenario envisions systems providing algorithmic predictions and recommendations to enhance human decision-making, offering enhanced efficiency while maintaining human judgment and accountability. However, it also requires debate over algorithm transparency, appropriate machine learning methods, and data privacy and security. The AI-driven scenario, meanwhile, imagines a fully autonomous and iterative AI. While potentially even more efficient, this future risks failing to align with academic values and norms, perpetuating data biases, and neglecting the important social bonds and community practices embedded in and strengthened by the human-led editorial process. We consider and contrast the two scenarios in terms of their usefulness and dangers to authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers. We conclude by cautioning against the lure of an AI-driven, metric-focused approach, advocating instead for a future where AI serves as a tool to augment human capacity and strengthen the quality of academic discourse. But more broadly, this thought experiment allows us to distill what the editorial process is about: the building of a premier research community instead of chasing metrics and efficiency. It is up to us to guard these values.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T21:01:53Z", "created_date": "2024-01-02T16:51:06Z", "deposited_date": "2024-01-02T16:51:20Z", "accepted_date": null}

To help shed light on insiders’ adaptive and maladaptive responses to IS security measures, we conducted a case study of an organization at the forefront of security policy initiatives. Drawing on the beliefs-actions-outcomes (BAO) model to analyze our case data, we uncover a potentially nonvirtuous cycle consisting of security-related beliefs, actions, and outcomes, which we refer to as an “adversarial dance.” Explaining our results, we describe a novel belief framework that identifies four security belief profiles and uncovers an underexplored outcome of IS security: insiders’ lived security experiences. We find that individuals’ unfavorable lived security experiences produce counterproductive security-related beliefs that, in turn, lead to maladaptive behaviors. Maladaptive behaviors create new potential for security risk, leading to increased organizational security measures to counter them. Thus, the adversarial dance continues, as the new security measures have the potential to reinforce counterproductive security-related beliefs about the importance and risk of IS security and lead to new maladaptive behaviors. To help situate our findings within the current security literature, we integrate the results with prior research based on extant theories. While this paper is not the first to suggest that security measures can elicit maladaptive behaviors, the emergent belief framework and expanded BAO model of IS security constitute an important contribution to the behavioral IS security literature.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-07-11T10:42:07Z", "created_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:15Z", "deposited_date": "2023-01-04T13:16:25Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, such behavior may lead to the skills they display straddling multiple categories, that is, “skill spanning.” In this paper, we extend the concept of category spanning into online labor markets in the form of skill spanning and empirically examine (1) how freelancers’ skill spanning affects employers’ hiring decisions for two different types of jobs (low- and high-skill jobs, respectively), and (2) how freelancers’ skill matching moderates the effects of skill spanning on employers’ hiring decisions. Based on a unique dataset of 12,428 high-skill jobs and 19,875 low-skill jobs on a leading online labor platform, we find that freelancers’ skill spanning has different impacts on employers’ hiring decisions for these two job types. Specifically, for high-skill jobs, freelancers’ skill spanning reduces their likelihood of winning contracts; however, for low-skill jobs, freelancers’ skill spanning and their probabilities of winning contracts demonstrate an inverse U-shape relationship. Furthermore, freelancers’ skill matching can moderate the negative effects of skill spanning for high-skill jobs but not for low-skill jobs. Our findings provide guidelines for different stakeholders in online labor markets, including freelancers and platform owners.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-09T20:47:03Z", "created_date": "2022-05-10T15:36:32Z", "deposited_date": "2022-05-11T03:40:06Z", "accepted_date": null}

As most of the extant studies have largely examined insider threats at a high level of abstraction, the role of situational moral reasoning for information security policy (ISP) violations in specific situations has received little attention. To advance this line of research, this paper opens up a potentially fruitful path for IS researchers by applying situational action theory (SAT) to contextually examine why employees violate ISPs in particular situations. We consider the violations of password security policy, internet use policy, and confidential data security policy, and examine specific violation intents ranging from altruistic to malicious. The results support most of the assertions derived from SAT. We found situational moral beliefs to be the predominant driver for ISP violations across three situations in an organizational setting. However, the moderation effect of moral beliefs was only significant in situations involving sharing passwords and selling confidential data. Sanction certainty and sanction severity were also found to have different effects across situations. We conclude by presenting implications for IS security practitioners and suggestions for future research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 11, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-28T20:44:41Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T16:28:54Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:29:06Z", "accepted_date": null}

Yet despite its importance and centrality, the conceptualization of space in information systems is not as sophisticated or mature as in other fields. A lack of attention to the diversity of perspectives on space hampers ongoing research and the re-visioning of phenomena that could lead to new insights in information systems. The aim of this paper is to develop an encompassing framework that provides a comprehensive view of philosophical perspectives, spatial themes, and concepts of space that are relevant to information systems. As a result of an extensive literature review, an encompassing framework is presented that includes four prominent spatial themes: representing space, differentiating space, disclosing space, and intuitive space. Each theme is related to its key characteristics and features and underlying philosophical perspectives. The paper demonstrates how the new framework can facilitate IS scholars’ expansive analysis in scholarly work and assist editors and reviewers in evaluating papers concerning space in IS and shows how the re-visioning of phenomena can lead to transformational shifts in understanding IS phenomena.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-05-07T14:06:47Z", "created_date": "2024-03-03T23:35:58Z", "deposited_date": "2024-03-03T23:36:10Z", "accepted_date": null}

We treat the efforts to design each solution as a “case,” capture primary data from multiple sources, and analyze it in light of three facets of social inclusion drawn from prior work: self-determination, belongingness, and social capital. The findings are interpreted to derive five principles for a socially inclusive design-oriented research process: (1) respecting multiperspective problem ownership and integrated solution design, (2) surfacing emic contributions to guide artifact design, (3) leveraging the support network to shape artifact design and refine research conduct, (4) customizing design-evaluate cycles with inclusive practices, and (5) pursuing authenticity in research collaborations.

We\nfurther hypothesize that PsyCap moderates the effect of adoption intentions on actual adoption rates\nbecause activating an individual’s HERO within encourages individuals to exert the effort necessary\nto translate their intentions into actual adoption. Finally, we theorize that enhancing fear appeal\nmessages with appeals to an individual’s HERO has a greater effect on volitional adoption rates\nrelative to messages without these PsyCap-related appeals. To support our hypotheses, we conducted\ntwo experiments using the volitional adoption of a password manager application and a two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) service. We found differential support for our hypotheses across the two\nsecurity technologies, which suggests technology characteristics might mitigate the impact of\nPsyCap on volitional adoption decisions.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-23T14:18:41Z", "created_date": "2023-05-10T21:29:49Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-08T01:31:04Z", "accepted_date": null}

Based on survey data\nfrom 760 participants, we found that the impact of AL is partially mediated by employees’\nperceptions of sanctions, the impact of BL is partially mediated by employees’ perceptions of the\ninformation security climate, and the impact of ML is partially mediated by employees’ perceptions\nof both sanctions and the information security climate. Our research extends the existing literature\nby exploring the impact of specific leadership styles on employees’ perceptions of information\nsecurity control mechanisms and by proposing that perceptions of information security control\nmechanisms play a mediating role between PL and ISP compliance.

The sustainability of microtask crowdsourcing platforms and the timely completion of microtask batches hinge on microworkers’ continued participation, but our understanding of microworkers’ continuance remains unclear. Drawing on the theory of the allocation of time and the research on work motivational orientations, we hypothesize that three motivational orientations (i.e., compensation, enjoyment, and microtime structure) are positively associated with microworkers’ perceived relative advantage of microworking, which in turn enhances microworkers’ intent to continue microworking. The relationships between the three motivational orientations and relative advantage are moderated by microworkers’ perceived situational boredom and microwork status (i.e., ad hoc, part-time, and full-time). An online survey on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk provides empirical evidence for the predictive powers, which are contingent on situational boredom, of the three motivational orientations on relative advantage, suggesting that fine-grained microtasks cater to the inherent desire to structure time at a microlevel. We further found that the relationships between motivational orientations and relative advantage differ across ad hoc, part-time, and full-time microworkers. Our study sheds light on theorizing users’ participation by incorporating the time lens and distinguishing heterogeneous effects across temporal contexts and user types. Our findings also provide important practical implications for the design and organization of microwork as well as the governance of the crowdsourcing platform.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 15, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-07-02T16:23:59Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:06Z", "accepted_date": null}

The literature has primarily focused on the use of fitness apps at the individual level (i.e., to improve individuals’ exercise levels) and few studies have investigated the role of fitness apps in facilitating group exercise. Consequently, there is a paucity of information on how to enhance the exercise participation of individuals using fitness apps through the use of groups (i.e., how to entice more individuals to engage in exercise). We selected a running app as the context and focused on a particular feature of this app called “Running Spot,” which facilitates members’ offline group engagement, a topic that has thus far received scant attention in the literature. Drawing on the perspective of psychological distance and relational cohesion theory, we propose that the Running Spot feature facilitating offline group engagement improved group participation in running. To advance this line of research, we utilized a panel dataset of 151 running groups from the running app platform over a period of 38 weeks. The aim was to empirically evaluate the effects of offline group engagement facilitation (e.g., Running Spot) using a combination of the difference-indifferences approach and the propensity score matching technique. Our findings suggest that Running Spot indeed promoted groups’ participation in running. Furthermore, the impact of Running Spot was magnified with smaller groups and groups that were moderately closely located to the designated running spots. Our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on fitness technologies by revealing ways to support group participation and uncovering the complex impact of offline group engagement facilitation (e.g., Running Spot). Our study has important implications for fitness app developers in that it demonstrates that features facilitating offline group engagement should be prioritized to improve group participation in fitness activities.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-16T13:10:19Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-08T03:00:40Z", "accepted_date": null}

Building on prior literature, we propose a theoretical model that conceptualizes KMS use as a valuable resource and distinguish between two types of cognitive engagement: professional cognitive engagement and organizational cognitive engagement. These, in turn, mediate the KMS use-job performance and KMS use-organizational commitment relationships. We tested the model on a sample of 3354 real estate agents using an extensive dataset comprised of primary and secondary data. The findings show that KMS use has an impact on individuals’ professional and organizational cognitive engagement, which then impacts their job performance and organizational commitment. However, our findings indicate that professional cognitive engagement only partially mediates the relationship between KMS use and job performance.

However, inconclusive findings on the effectiveness of IS certifications on websites have emerged, critically challenging their usefulness. We seek to reconcile these inconclusive findings by drawing on swift trust theory and the notion of humans as cognitive misers. Specifically, we investigate whether the effects of IS certifications are contingent on visitors’ expectations and the website’s baseline trustworthiness (i.e., the original website before adding and visitors’ processing of IS certifications). Through a multistudy investigation combining an online (N = 191) and a follow-up field experiment with up to €4 million in sales volume (N = 306), we reveal the contingent effects of IS certifications on the trustworthiness of websites: Below (but not above) a certain level of a website’s baseline trustworthiness (i.e., the trust tipping point), IS certifications significantly increase trustworthiness. We also show that IS certifications do not increase the likelihood of user registrations (i.e., trust-related behavior) when a website’s baseline trustworthiness surpasses this trustworthiness threshold. Overall, we provide an important new perspective that explains and resolves previous inconsistent findings on the (in)effectiveness of IS certifications for trustworthiness and subsequent trust-related behaviors. We equip practitioners with valuable and actionable guidance on the usefulness of IS certifications to strengthen their digital businesses.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-12T19:01:47Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:44Z", "accepted_date": null}

A framework from Shneiderman (2022) for human-centered AI is employed to consider journal publishing practices that can address the principles of responsible AI at different levels. The resultant AI principled governance matrix (AI-PGM) for journal publishing shows how countermeasures for risks can be employed at the levels of the author-researcher team, the organization, the industry, and by government regulation. The AI-PGM allows a structured approach to responsible AI and may be modified as developments with AI unfold.

The challenge is becoming\nparticularly critical in higher education institutions suffering from low retention rates and low\ngraduation rates among first-generation college students (FGCS). In response to the challenges\nimposed by the notion of social inclusion, some universities and colleges are exploring the use of\nsocial networking technologies such as social media (SM) in ways that can impact social inclusion.\nIn order to improve the understanding of how social networking technology affects the social\ninclusion of FGCS, we conducted a case study in a public, Hispanic-serving institution in the United\nStates. We used technology affordance theory to reveal various affordances actualized by FGCS and\nvarious outcomes resulting from those affordances. To explain how the actualization of different\nstrands of affordance produces certain outcomes, our analysis of 102 FGCS’ narratives followed an\nestablished five-step framework for identifying generative mechanisms, revealing three SM user\ntypes—Community Builders, Scholars, and Information Seekers—and four actualized affordances,\nnamely interconnection, inspiration, insightfulness, and intense comfort, which are conceptualized\ninto three generative mechanisms: identity booster, academic growth, and self-care. Our results\nprovide insights into SM usage for social inclusion outcomes. By revealing how technology use can\npromote social engagement and mitigate exclusion experienced by FGCS, this study contributes to\nthe broad social inclusion research on technology and disadvantaged communities.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-26T16:44:09Z", "created_date": "2023-09-08T19:42:06Z", "deposited_date": "2023-09-08T19:42:21Z", "accepted_date": null}

This polarized perspective neglects the\nnuanced, pragmatic manifestation of GAI. In general, extreme views oversimplify the technology itself\nor its potential to address societal issues. The authors suggest a more balanced analysis, acknowledging\nthat GAI’s impacts will unfold dynamically over time as diverse implementations interact with human\nstakeholders and contextual factors. While Big Tech firms dominate GAI’s supply, its demand is\nexpected to evolve through experimentation and use cases. The authors argue that GAI’s societal impact\ndepends on identifiable contingencies, emphasizing three broad factors: the balance between\nautomation and augmentation, the congruence of physical and digital realities, and the retention of\nhuman bounded rationality. These contingencies represent trade-offs arising from GAI instantiations,\nshaped by technological advancements, stakeholder dynamics, and contextual factors, including\nsocietal responses and regulations. Predicting long-term societal effects remains challenging due to\nunforeseeable discontinuities in the technology’s trajectory. The authors anticipate a continuous\ninterplay between GAI initiatives, technological advances, learning experiences, and societal\nresponses, with outcomes depending on the above contingencies.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 35, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-05T11:53:19Z", "created_date": "2024-01-02T16:51:06Z", "deposited_date": "2024-01-02T16:51:15Z", "accepted_date": null}

We use image theory to develop a model of discontinuation (MOD), which includes five main concepts: shock, script, image violation, service and task dissatisfaction, and search for and evaluation of superior alternatives. MOD explains how two types of user discontinuation behavior—quitting and switching—are formed along seven paths that are either related to contextual or technological shocks or result from dissatisfaction with a task or service. Our first empirical study shows that more than 95% of the 467 ex-users surveyed followed one of these paths when discontinuing media streaming, social networking, and matchmaking services. In the second study, we developed a research model based on the MOD to understand how the psychological factors associated with shocks lead to the intention to discontinue. We evaluate this model with a scenario study in which we present the situation of users of a matchmaking service and present participants with a contextual shock. Data from 201 individuals show that users are likely to develop intentions to quit when they use an engaged script or experience an image violation. Interviews with a panel of practitioners confirmed that MOD provides a useful and applicable approach to understanding users’ quitting and switching behaviors in different contexts. We conclude our paper with a discussion of implications for research and practice.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-07-02T20:15:55Z", "created_date": "2024-03-03T23:35:58Z", "deposited_date": "2024-03-03T23:36:09Z", "accepted_date": null}

They occur when rules and norms are encoded into a digital infrastructure and change practices. For institutionalization to occur, numerous actors must alter their behavior similarly, which accompanies a shift in infrastructural technology. Digital infrastructures and their design play a crucial role in institutionalization processes, as they enable and restrict social interaction in the exchange of digital institutional entities across contexts. Such entities are constitutive of digital institutional systems—medical prescriptions, money, insurance, and taxes are all institutional entities that have been digitalized. Although several studies have described the challenges of digital infrastructure design, there has been little consideration of the institutional context that legitimizes the design. To fill this research gap, we applied the critical perspective of designers, who intentionally perform and are responsible for the design and legitimacy of digital institutional systems. To address the challenge of institutional design, we developed an exchange contract within an institutional context featuring a change in digital infrastructure and practices. Through this, we illuminate several design principles for digital institutionalization. This contribution captures critical design decisions and the knowledge acquired through insights gained from the design of a highly impactful scalable digital infrastructure, which ultimately transformed an institutional system. We also provide theoretical reflections informed by speech act theory and institutional theory and thereby emphasize the need to rethink institutionalization processes in an era of digitalization.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-06-07T06:26:18Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:43Z", "accepted_date": null}

Despite this, recent research shows a lack of oversight by the board of directors over the IT function due to the “IT confidence gap” of directors with no IT expertise. This has resulted in the emergence of a recent trend of appointing CITEs to the board of directors. However, there is little research on whether such appointments result in value creation for the appointing firms. We use perspectives from agency and resource dependence theories to examine two value impacts of CITE director appointments to address this question. We suggest that CITE director appointments create signaling value by enhancing the firm’s ability to signal their intention to institute more effective oversight of the IT function and subsequently accumulate value in the form of share price reaction to appointment announcements. Correspondingly, CITE directors’ human and relational capital application also creates substantive value in the form of firm financial performance over a longer duration. Using an event study and hierarchical linear modeling, our analysis of 334 CITE director appointments largely supports our contention that the human and relational capital of CITE directors and their appointment in firms facing IT-related contextual conditions results in both a positive share price reaction and better firm financial performance over the long term. We conclude that appointing CITE directors with the appropriate capital under certain contextual conditions leads to firm value creation.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T14:20:55Z", "created_date": "2022-07-10T22:44:45Z", "deposited_date": "2022-07-10T22:44:46Z", "accepted_date": null}

First, we propose novel lifestyle-based risk constructs (e.g., opinion risk) to capture consumers’ deep-level diversity. Second, we incorporate these lifestyle-based risk constructs into econometric models to empirically evaluate the relationship between consumers’ deep-level diversity and their credit risk. Using a credit scoring dataset provided by a fintech firm listed on Nasdaq, our econometric analysis reveals that consumers’ opinion risk constructs extracted from their multimodal social media posts are positively associated with their credit risk. Furthermore, our results show that the proposed opinion risk constructs can significantly improve the effectiveness of predicting consumers’ credit risk.

Although launching a BBP involves bounties as well as the costs of processing bug reports and fixing bugs, software firms can save failure costs and enjoy the benefits of greater user trust. The costs and benefits resulting from launching a BBP vary with launch timings and software licensing models. Hence, we investigate the optimal BBP launch strategies for software firms, using perpetual or subscription licensing models. Our findings reveal that under perpetual licensing, the firm has only two viable launch strategies: simultaneous launch, i.e., launching the software and the BBP simultaneously, and no launch. Under subscription licensing, however, delayed launch, i.e., launching the BBP later than the software release time, occurs as the optimal strategy when the failure cost is not high and the benefit of user trust is significant. Two distinct patterns in the relationship between the firm’s bug-fixing capability and its payoff are identified: a U-shaped pattern and an inverted U-shaped pattern. We uncover the conditions under which a firm should opt not to launch a BBP as its bug-fixing capability improves. This study offers insights into how firms can be motivated to launch BBPs to improve the overall reliability of their software.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-08-06T21:01:43Z", "created_date": "2024-03-03T23:35:58Z", "deposited_date": "2024-03-03T23:36:03Z", "accepted_date": null}

We argue that an\nemployee’s local IW (i.e., immediate supervisor and coworkers) has a strong effect on security. This\npaper focuses on the effects of these mesolevel factors in the presence of macro- and microlevel\nfactors. Drawing on the social structure and social learning framework as well as workgroup\nresearch, we hypothesize that the security behavior of an employee’s IW supervisor and coworkers\nmoderated by the nature of these relationships influences information security decisions. Our\nresearch, based on a sample of 217 full-time employees, reveals that the IW significantly affects\nsecurity decisions, over and above the micro- and macrolevel factors. These effects are moderated\nby the nature of the relationship between employees and their IW supervisor (leader-member\nexchange) and coworkers (team-member exchange). A post hoc analysis shows that the mesolevel\nfactors alone had the same explanatory power as the micro- and macrolevels combined. Our research\nsuggests that future theory and research should include the IW and that organizations should share\nsecurity responsibilities with line managers and help them understand their substantial impact on\ninformation security. Security training programs should ask employees about the behaviors of their\nIW supervisor and coworkers and, where needed, deliver anti-neutralization training to mitigate the\neffects of the IW’s noncompliance behaviors.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-28T20:38:20Z", "created_date": "2023-07-11T11:38:09Z", "deposited_date": "2023-07-11T11:38:17Z", "accepted_date": null}

Considering the high volume of submissions and limited reviewer resources, there is a pressing need to use AI to augment the review process. At the same time, advances in AI have been accompanied by concerns about biases introduced by AI tools and the ethics of using them, among other issues such as hallucinations. Thus, critical issues to understand are: how can AI augment and potentially automate the review process, what are the pitfalls in doing so, and what er the implications for IS research and peer review practice.

The latest wave of data science research, pertaining to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), is growing exponentially and garnering millions of annual citations. However, this growth has been accompanied by a diminishing emphasis on social good challenges—our analysis reveals that the proportion of data science research focusing on social good is less than it has ever been. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning and generative AI has sparked debates about the sociotechnical prospects and challenges associated with data science for human flourishing, organizations, and society. Against this backdrop, we present a framework for “data science for social good” (DSSG) research that considers the interplay between relevant data science research genres, social good challenges, and different levels of sociotechnical abstraction. We perform an analysis of the literature to empirically demonstrate the paucity of work on DSSG in information systems (and other related disciplines) and highlight current impediments. We then use our proposed framework to introduce the articles appearing in the JAIS special issue on data science for social good. We hope that this editorial and the special issue will spur future DSSG research and help reverse the alarming trend across data science research over the past 30-plus years in which social good challenges are attracting proportionately less attention with each passing day</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-05T13:07:44Z", "created_date": "2023-11-06T01:22:40Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T14:52:42Z", "accepted_date": null}

Past research has indicated a gap in approaches that are designed for SMEs since BC management approaches tend to originate from larger organizations and SMEs lack the resources to implement them. To fill this gap, and to respond to a practical need by an IT consultancy company, we employed design science research (DSR) to develop a BC approach for SMEs coined as the thrifty BC management approach. Jointly with the company’s practitioners, we developed a set of meta-requirements for BC approaches for SMEs anchored in prior BC literature, practitioners’ practical expertise, and the theories of collective mindfulness and sociotechnical systems. We evaluated our thrifty BC management approach with multiple SMEs. These evaluations suggest that the designed approach mostly meets the defined meta-requirements. Moreover, the evaluations offered ample opportunities for learning. The design process, unfolding in a real-world setting, was precarious, rife with contingencies and ad hoc decisions. To render the design process transparent, we adapted four writing conventions from the confessional research genre familiar to ethnographic research but novel to DSR. We offer a threefold contribution.

Data may be iteratively manipulated algorithmically, undermining the “faithfulness” of data to any originating phenomenon.

We empirically study how a community of commercially based geoscientists grapples with the phenomenon of offshore oil and gas reservoirs located kilometers below the seabed. The data available about these reservoirs are algorithmically manipulated sensor-based Internet of Things data. Our main contribution is the articulation of three patterns of work practices detailing how inherently uncertain data are woven into consequential work practices: (1) Accumulating is the cumulative process of supporting and triangulating one set of data with supplementary data sets; accumulating captures the conservative approach of backing up existing interpretations of the data. (2) Reframing describes the process where existing interpretations are contested by new data or models; reframing captures that there are limits to how far data can be manipulated. (3) Prospecting, or the cultivation of competing, incompatible data interpretations; while the former two patterns essentially attempt to regulate uncertainty, prospecting is about embracing it.

Studies have rarely investigated the mechanism of abrupt changes in OIB at the group level. To address the research gaps and advance this area of research, we employed a sequential multiple-methods approach. First, we designed a questionnaire to obtain and analyze consumer data to identify OIB drivers. Second, we built a qualitative catastrophe model based on empirical findings to describe sudden changes in the OIB behavior of individuals by merging catastrophe theory (CT) and qualitative simulation (QSIM). Finally, grounded in the qualitative catastrophe model, we constructed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate group-level OIB behavior. The empirical findings revealed the following. (1) Sudden changes in group-level OIB occur as consumers’ sense of quantified self increases when self-control is low. (2) The greater the number of consumers with a proving preference (who prefer to prove their competence and performance to others) in the group, the higher the possibility of catastrophe; the scale of catastrophe increases significantly with the enhancement of product information features. (3) We identify optimal gamification for sudden increases in group-level OIB; the larger the degree of social networking is, the higher the likelihood of catastrophe behavior. Our proposed combination of a survey study, QSIM, and an ABM is a plausible solution for behavioral research on consumers, and the integration paradigm could help maintain market stability and promote products.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T17:07:27Z", "created_date": "2024-03-03T18:35:58Z", "deposited_date": "2024-03-03T18:36:06Z", "accepted_date": null}

To envisage the future trajectory of scientific journals, it’s imperative to comprehend the operational mechanisms of these models and the fundamentally recombinatorial nature of human knowledge creation. I suggest that one of the significant roles generative AI can play is facilitating “long jumps” in our knowledge exploration process. I further propose decentralization and deferred and temporary binding as two crucial characteristics of the evolving epistemic infrastructure that supports precarious knowledge production. I foresee a future where scientific journals extend beyond their traditional gatekeeping roles.

They work away from a home or office work base at customer and remote work sites and are highly dependent on ICT for completing their work tasks. Low occupational well-being is a key concern regarding BC-RMWs. The objective of this research is to understand how BC-RMWs can use information and communication technology (ICT) to elevate their occupational well-being. Drawing from the job demands-job resources theoretical framework in occupational psychology, we theorize that the distinctive work characteristics faced by BC-RMWs can be viewed in the conceptual framing of job demands. We conceptualize BC-RMWs’ practices of ICT use as possible ways to gather resources to tackle these demands. We conducted a study of 28 BC-RMWs employed in two private sector firms (telecom service provision and construction industries) in the UK across 14 remote work sites. Based on our findings, we developed the concept of ICT-enabled job crafting and theorized how ICT-enabled job crafting by BC-RMWs can help them increase their job resources to tackle their job demands and consequently increase their occupational well-being. The empirical context of the paper, i.e., the study of BC-RMWs, provides further novelty because these kinds of workers and their distinctive and interesting work conditions have not received much attention in the literature.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 19, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-04T13:23:18Z", "created_date": "2022-05-10T11:36:32Z", "deposited_date": "2022-05-10T23:40:05Z", "accepted_date": null}

They have the potential to reduce dependency on traditional health information channels, increase health literacy and empower a broader range of individuals in relation to their health management decisions. Successful communities are characterized by high levels of trust in user-generated contributions, which is reflected in increased engagement and expressed through knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution. However, research shows that the majority of OHCs are composed of passive participants who do not contribute via posts, thereby threatening the sustainability of many communities and their potential for empowerment. Despite this fact, the relationship between trust and engagement, specifically the trust antecedents that influence engagement in the OHC community context has not been adequately explained in past research. In this study, we leverage social capital behavior and social exchange theory frameworks in order to provide a more granular trust-based elucidation of the factors that influence individuals’ engagement in OHCs. We collected data from 410 Brazilian participants of Facebook OHCs and tested the research model using partial least squares. The results confirm two new constructs—online community responsiveness and community support—as trust antecedents that influence engagement in OHCs, resulting in knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution responses. These findings contribute to the trust and engagement literatures and to social media research knowledge. From a practitioner perspective, the study findings can serve as an important guide for moderators and managers seeking to develop trusted and impactful OHCs.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 19, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-05T19:54:53Z", "created_date": "2023-03-07T17:40:17Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-08T03:00:33Z", "accepted_date": null}

In particular, the connective action of social media builds associations and allows for the continuity of social movements. Yet there is a lack of research on how connective action emergent from social media messages sustains long-term social movements. Accordingly, in this study, we concentrate on Twitter messages related to Women’s March protests held in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Using an interpretive analysis followed by the topic modeling approach, we analyzed the tweets to identify the different types of messages associated with the movement. These messages were classified using a set of categories and subcategories. Furthermore, we conducted a temporal analysis of the message (sub)categories to understand how distinct messages allow movement continuity beyond a specific protest march. Results suggest that while most of the messages are used to motivate and mobilize individuals, the connective action tactics employed through messages sent before, during, and after the marches allowed Women’s March to become a broader and more persistent movement. We advance theoretical propositions to explain the sustainability of a long-term social movement on social media, exemplified through large-scale connective action that persists over time. In doing so, this study contributes to connective action research by providing message categorization that synthesizes the meaning of message content. The findings could help social movement organizers learn different ways to frame messages that resonate with broader social media users. Moreover, our approach to analyzing a large set of tweets might interest other qualitative researchers.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 14, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-03T18:17:27Z", "created_date": "2023-01-04T08:16:15Z", "deposited_date": "2023-01-04T08:16:28Z", "accepted_date": null}

Drawing on an exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment, it describes a case of an organization successfully “enveloping” its AI solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible AI models with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. The authors present several envelopment methods—establishing clear boundaries within which the AI is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the training data well, and appropriately managing input and output sources—alongside their influence on the choice of AI models within the organization. This work makes two key contributions: It introduces the concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which an organization’s successful AI envelopment depends on the interaction of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature’s focus beyond mere technical issues. Secondly, the empirical examples illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high performance presented by inscrutable models. These contributions pave the way for more responsible, accountable AI implementations in organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even inscrutable machine-learning models.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 82, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-06T09:19:14Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T04:01:22Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-07T17:36:11Z", "accepted_date": null}

Although these dashboards aim to make crisisrelated information accessible to the general public, the average user can have a hard time interacting with them and finding the information needed to make everyday decisions. To address this challenge, we draw on the theory of effective use to propose a theory-driven design for conversational dashboards intended for crisis response that can improve users’ transparent interaction with these dashboards and facilitate access to crisis-related information during crises. We instantiate our proposed design in a conversational dashboard for the COVID-19 pandemic that enables natural language interaction in spoken or written form and helps users familiarize themselves with the use of natural language through conversational onboarding. The evaluation of our artifact shows that being able to use natural language improves users’ interaction with the dashboard and ultimately increases their efficiency and effectiveness in finding information. This positive effect is amplified when users complete the onboarding before interacting with the dashboard, particularly when they can use both natural language and mouse interaction. Our findings contribute to research on dashboard design, both in general and in the specific context of crisis response, by providing prescriptive knowledge for extending crisis response dashboards with natural language interaction capabilities. In addition, our work contributes to the democratization of data science by proposing design guidelines for making information on crisis response dashboards more accessible to the general public.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 8, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-26T22:17:09Z", "created_date": "2023-11-06T01:22:40Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T14:52:45Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, extant research has largely focused on existing members’ behavior, leaving the issue of newcomers’ contribution behavior relatively unexplored. This research proposes a theoretical framework for understanding why newcomers engage in contribution processes, how group engagement leads to normative pressure, and whether normative pressure has curvilinear effects on information contributions. Drawing on the theory of engagement, we propose that newcomer group engagement, characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption, exerts dual effects on information contributions. We also argue that newcomers who personally engage in contribution processes tend to reveal three key psychological conditions: meaningfulness (i.e., a sense of return on investments of the self in contribution processes), safety (i.e., a sense of being able to show and express oneself without fear of negative consequences), and availability (i.e., a sense of readiness to engage personally in contribution processes). We further investigate a focal antecedent for each psychological condition. Using multisource data collected at three points in time, this research finds that value congruence, perceived group support, and contribution self-efficacy positively influence newcomer group engagement, which in turn leads to greater information contribution behaviors. This study also shows that greater group engagement can initiate a spiral of social role expectations, leading to heightened levels of normative pressure. Moreover, normative pressure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with information contribution behavior.

We contextualize and extend CQ theory, which\nhas previously focused on face-to-face contexts, to the virtual collaborative GVT environment. For\nthis, we conceptualize the significant role of deep-level implicitly negotiated adaptative behavior\n(role structure adaptation) in GVTs—in addition to surface-level explicitly displayed adaptative\nbehavior (CQ behavior). We tested the proposed model through a sequential mixed methods\napproach that integrated the results from a quantitative two-wave survey study with findings from a\nqualitative study comprising expert interviews, to arrive at rich and robust inferences and metainferences. The proposed CQ-for-GVT framework, along with delineated boundary conditions and\nassociated propositions, explicates an integrative model explaining the role of CQ for GVT creativity\nperformance.

Tackling firestorms is difficult because the judgments and responses from social media users are influenced by not only the nature of the transgressions but also by the reactions and opinions of other social media users. Drawing on the heuristic-systematic information processing model, we propose a research model to explain the effects of social impact (the heuristic mode) and argument quality and moral intensity (the systematic mode) on perceptions of firm wrongness (the judgment outcome) as well as the effects of perceptions of firm wrongness on vindictive complaining and patronage reduction. We adopted a mixed methods approach in our investigation, including a survey, an experiment, and a focus group study. Our findings show that the heuristic and systematic modes of information processing exert both direct and interaction effects on individuals’ judgment. Specifically, the heuristic mode of information processing dominates overall and also biases the systematic mode. Our study advances the literature by offering an alternative explanation for the emergence of social media firestorms and identifying a novel context in which the heuristic mode dominates in dual information processing. It also sheds light on the formulation of response strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from social media firestorms.

Our research orientation toward the future assumes continuity and the extension of past patterns into a predictable and thus manageable future. In this research, we propose speculative engagement through digital geographies to make visible the processes of technological and cultural reconfiguration that result in unprecedented change. After describing the conception of “the future” in widely used research methods, we describe speculative engagement as a research orientation to disclose new categories, relationships, and values and a commitment to the performative relationships of our current research practices with potential future(s). Digital geographies are internally consistent and coherent worlds that are cognitively plausible but estranging. They are carriers of meaning and culture that underpin a broad class of methods to provide richly experienced “other worlds.” We posit principles for effective digital geographies and provide an illustrative example of a digital human artifact that estranges us from current assumptions. Finally, we argue that our approach enables researchers to engage with the future on its own terms. In this way, researchers, designers, and policy makers can open current practices to new categories, relationships, logics, and values and make visible the unprecedented reconfigurations in which our research is implicated.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-05-19T15:46:00Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T13:50:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T13:50:48Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, the effects vary by individual, depending on whether the employee is actively engaging in physical activity, and by time, depending on how long the employee has been in the wellness program. We found light social support to be less effective over time, while motivational messages were found to be more effective with the duration in the program and generally more effective for physically inactive users.

We argue that well-trained, motivated, and empowered IT professionals can help firms make better strategic choices in allocating IT investments and implementing IT projects. We also demonstrate how this moderating relationship depends upon collaborative IS and autonomy-enhancing IS practices that affect other knowledge workers in the firm. We leverage archival data for 228 firms with 736 firm-year observations and document two key findings. We find (1) that empowering HR practices for IT professionals positively moderate the effect of IT investments on firm performance, and (2) that the alignment between empowering HR practices for IT professionals and firm-wide collaborative IS practices enhances the value that firms derive from IT investments.

Technically, such CDSSs are already feasible but physicians have been\nskeptical about their application. In particular, their opacity is a major concern, as it may lead physicians\nto overlook erroneous outputs from ML-based CDSSs, potentially causing serious consequences for\npatients. Research on explainable AI (XAI) offers methods with the potential to increase the\nexplainability of black-box ML systems. This could significantly accelerate the application of MLbased CDSSs in medicine. However, XAI research to date has mainly been technically driven and\nlargely neglects the needs of end users. To better engage the users of ML-based CDSSs, we applied a\ndesign science approach to develop a design for explainable ML-based CDSSs that incorporates\ninsights from XAI literature while simultaneously addressing physicians’ needs. This design comprises\nfive design principles that designers of ML-based CDSSs can apply to implement user-centered\nexplanations, which are instantiated in a prototype of an explainable ML-based CDSS for lung nodule\nclassification. We rooted the design principles and the derived prototype in a body of justificatory\nknowledge consisting of XAI literature, the concept of usability, and an online survey study involving\n57 physicians. We refined the design principles and their instantiation by conducting walk-throughs\nwith six radiologists. A final experiment with 45 radiologists demonstrated that our design resulted in\nphysicians perceiving the ML-based CDSS as more explainable and usable in terms of the required\ncognitive effort than a system without explanations.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 14, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-12T21:42:43Z", "created_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:09Z", "deposited_date": "2023-07-11T15:38:11Z", "accepted_date": null}

Verbal feedback (such as a review) can give details about how the recipient can improve their contribution, but it requires the recipient to read and process the feedback. Conversely, nonverbal feedback (such as an upvote) is easy to comprehend but does not convey much helpful information. Prior studies have mainly focused on the impact of verbal feedback. However, little has been done to explore the underlying mechanism of the effect of nonverbal peer feedback on people’s tendency to contribute more. We present two experimental studies conducted on Amazon Mechanic Turk. Study 1 demonstrates how verbal and nonverbal feedback impact user contributions differently. Next, building on attribution-emotion-action theory, we use Study 2 to establish a causal mechanism between nonverbal feedback and users’ knowledge contribution. Specifically, users who receive nonverbal peer feedback make internal and external attributions, which in turn impact their emotions and contribution decisions. We find that users receiving more positive feedback attribute this in equal measure internally to perceived self-efficacy and externally to perceived fairness, whereas users who receive negative feedback attribute it more to the lack of perceived fairness of peer feedback.

Studies suggest that top management support is an important driver of IT assimilation; however, this broad takeaway provides little substantive guidance to researchers and practitioners. We also have a limited understanding of whether and when IT assimilation creates business value. We take stock of this literature with a meta-analysis. We found that top management support is positively related to IT assimilation, and assimilation is in turn positively related to the business value of IT. We also found that explicit support does not have any special effect on IT assimilation (compared to implicit support) and may not be related to business value at all. However, our results indicate that IT assimilation has a stronger effect on business value at the process level (versus firm level) and for enterprise IT innovations (versus function IT innovations). Finally, we found that support-assimilation and assimilation-value relationships are stronger in high (versus low) power distance cultures.

Theoretically grounded in Andreoni’s warm-glow giving theory and Sober and Wilson’s model of evolutionary and psychological giving, this work has high practical relevance, given the increasing demand for Islamic financial products. Loan-based crowdfunding platforms are important to the unique context of this research since Islamic religious constraints regulate monetary transactions involving lending. We used a scenario-based survey developed on the basis of a pilot study and confirmed by our manipulation check. The results show that “hedonism” represented by monetary interest negatively affected Muslim users’ willingness to engage in a loan-based crowdfunding project. This finding challenges the commonly agreed-upon egoistic motivator for loan-based crowdfunding platforms (i.e., monetary interest), which is based on Western Christian and Chinese Confucian capitalist economic and financial paradigms. Remarkably, we also found that Muslim funders’ level of willingness to engage on the hedonistic platform had an exponentially positive effect on the amount of money that funders were willing to lend. By contrast, “warm-glow giving,” manifested as belonging to a community, had no effect on users’ engagement. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-09-16T08:38:24Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T04:01:22Z", "deposited_date": "2023-03-07T17:36:12Z", "accepted_date": null}

Prior studies examining the post-adoption consequences of IT use in terms of employee job outcomes have been inconclusive with respect to the magnitude and direction of these impacts—i.e., the positive, negative, and nonsignificant impacts of IT use on job outcomes. The question of under what conditions IT use leads to favorable job outcomes over time thus remains largely unanswered. We develop a model of IT-related contingencies that integrates core constructs from the IT adoption research with two key job outcomes: job satisfaction and job performance. We hypothesize that in the post-adoption phase, technology-job fit is a key moderator of the relationships between IT use for supporting sales operations and job outcomes. Further, we suggest a theoretical extension of the classical predictors of IT adoption—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use—as we expect them to moderate the effect of IT use on job performance over time. We tested our model in a longitudinal field study among 295 field sales personnel over a 24-month period. We found that although IT use had a negative effect on job satisfaction during the post-adoption phase, this effect was moderated by technology-job fit such that the negative effect was significantly attenuated by technology-job fit. We also found that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and technology-job fit enhanced the positive effect of IT use on job performance. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms and conditions related to the post-adoption impacts of IT use on key job outcomes.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-26T06:32:27Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:11Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, the functionality of these agents relies on the personal data obtained from their users. While evidence suggests that user disclosure can be increased through reciprocal self-disclosure (i.e., a process in which a CA discloses information about itself with the expectation that the user would reciprocate by disclosing similar information about themself), it is not clear whether and through which mechanism the process of reciprocal self-disclosure influences users’ post-interaction trust. We theorize that anthropomorphism (i.e., the extent to which a user attributes humanlike attributes to a nonhuman entity) serves as an inductive inference mechanism for understanding reciprocal self-disclosure, enabling users to build conceptually distinct cognitive and affective foundations upon which to form their post-interaction trust. We found strong support for our theory through two randomized experiments that used custom-developed text-based and voicebased CAs. Specifically, we found that reciprocal self-disclosure increases anthropomorphism and anthropomorphism increases cognition-based trustworthiness and affect-based trustworthiness. Our results show that reciprocal self-disclosure has an indirect effect on cognition-based trustworthiness and affect-based trustworthiness and is fully mediated by anthropomorphism. These findings conceptually bridge prior research on motivations of anthropomorphism and research on cognitive and affective bases of trust.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 10, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T18:09:02Z", "created_date": "2024-05-06T15:23:22Z", "deposited_date": "2024-05-07T07:57:41Z", "accepted_date": null}

The paper examines how emerging technologies can help the scientific community grapple with this predicament and reestablish an institutional logic that favors scholarship and world benefit over the economic interests of publishers. Building on Web3 technologies, the paper suggests a two-pronged strategy that relies primarily on blockchain and AI technologies to help restore a fair and equitable power balance and improve the publishing experience. This proposed course of action presents an opportunity to tackle the grand challenge faced by the academic publishing ecosystem while simultaneously asserting the IS community’s proclaimed role as stewards of the digital revolution.

Such work can help reveal more powerful explanations than that seen in a single study, thereby generating increased levels of understanding of a given phenomenon and greater research finding generalizability. Based on a review of the literature and a survey of qualitative researchers, we found that the information systems (IS) domain lacks a clear understanding of qualitative synthesis methods and, as a result, has largely failed to take advantage of this powerful, high-potential methodological opportunity. To address this shortcoming, this paper is the first to provide a rigorous overview of the full suite of 35 qualitative synthesis methods, as well as guidelines that include a three-tiered selection framework. By using the guidelines and framework in tandem, IS researchers are able to select the qualitative synthesis method most appropriate for a given research study, particularly when the research objective involves knowledge integration/aggregation, interpretation/theory development, and/or informing IS practice.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 8, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-20T12:35:40Z", "created_date": "2022-05-10T15:36:32Z", "deposited_date": "2022-05-11T03:40:03Z", "accepted_date": null}

Drawing on decision-making theory and organizational information processing theory, we conceptualize two patterns of BDA usage for supply chain (SC) activities (BDA use for SC optimization and BDA use for SC learning) and report two complementary channels via which the two BDA usage patterns impact a supply chain organization’s BDA-enabled decision-making capability. An analysis of questionnaire data from supply chain managers representing 157 companies based in North American suggests that BDA use for SC optimization is directly associated with better decision-making capability. In contrast, the influence of BDA use for SC learning does not impact decision-making directly but indirectly, as its effect is fully mediated by organizational integration. We discuss the implications of these findings for future academic research and for managers in practice who seek to maximize business values from BDA implementations.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 37, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T13:35:50Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:24:42Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, a clear understanding of\nhow online gamified competition cultivates exercise behaviors in different types of individuals is still\nlacking. We take into account the individual differences in exercise behaviors and categorize exercisers\ninto three groups (active, moderate, and inactive) based on an adapted recency, frequency, and\nmonetary value framework using key exercise behavior metrics. Theorizing online gamified\ncompetition as a means of social and temporal self-comparison, we examine the effect of performance\nfeedback from two distinct modes of comparison (performance rankings and performance gap), and\nparticipants’ relationships with their social comparison referents (i.e., rivalry intensity), on the exercise\nbehaviors of different exerciser groups. Our results reveal that online gamified competition has\ndifferential effects on exercise behaviors across different exerciser groups. Specifically, we find that\npositive performance improvements are more motivational for active and moderate exercisers, while\nperformance deterioration relative to historical exercise performance level is more discouraging for\ninactive exercisers. Performance rankings exhibit a more salient effect for moderate and inactive\nexercisers, and rivalry intensity has a stronger positive effect on active exercisers’ exercise behavior.\nThe strengthening effect of awareness affordances in mobile fitness apps is more notable with regard\nto the impact of rivalry intensity on moderate and inactive exercisers. We derive theoretical and\npractical implications of gamified information systems that use competition as a core design element\nfor shaping the exercise behavior of individuals in different exerciser groups. </jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-21T16:53:08Z", "created_date": "2023-05-10T17:29:49Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T20:31:13Z", "accepted_date": null}

This paper examines the relationship between firm-generated content and user engagement on product pages and whether a page’s characteristics and content motivations moderate this relationship. Analyzing a sample of 29,267 posts on 85 Facebook product pages of 49 Fortune 1000 firms, we studied the relationship between the content (i.e., informational vs. emotional) and style (i.e., formal vs. informal) of a given post and the level of user engagement. The key finding is that in the content dimension, “incongruous” posts, i.e., content not traditionally expected for a product page of a given type, generate more favorable engagement. Also, informal style posts achieve more favorable engagement irrespective of the product page characteristics. The secondary discovery is attributable to Facebook’s function as a social media network where acquaintances engage with one another. The platform’s unwritten protocol of communication largely emphasizes informality, which is likely the driver of this observation. These findings contribute to the burgeoning social media strategy literature illustrating how product page characteristics moderate effective social media content strategies.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-07-16T13:48:04Z", "created_date": "2024-03-03T18:35:58Z", "deposited_date": "2024-03-03T18:36:07Z", "accepted_date": null}

Firms have traditionally chosen to communicate such information on a quarterly or annual basis, if at all, and prior research on the topic has largely focused on regulatory factors as driving forces. In this paper, we focus on timely disclosures (via 8-K filings) and derive hypotheses regarding the influences of two alternate forms of pressure as drivers of cybersecurity disclosures—(1) public pressure following a firm’s data breach and (2) pressure arising from the breaches of industry peers, which we cast as “institutional pressure.” We also theorize on how the source of the breach (internal or external) influences these forms of pressure. Our results suggest that firms’ cybersecurity disclosure practices are influenced by public pressure following a data breach and that this pressure is more acute for external breaches than for internal breaches. By contrast, breaches by industry peers, as a form of institutional pressure, appear to prompt fewer cybersecurity disclosures, except when the focal firm suffers its own external breach. From a theoretical perspective, our study supports a nuanced application of legitimacy theory in the cybersecurity disclosure context, especially in the midst of public and institutional pressure, such that the source of a data breach determines whether firms attempt to address the resultant legitimacy gap. From a practical perspective, our results may be viewed as alarming in that firms are not reacting to internal breaches with the same degree of communicative effort about cybersecurity as for external breaches, at least in terms of the timely disclosures we consider in this study. Our findings also point to certain levers that can promote timely cybersecurity disclosures, and thus have important policy implications.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 13, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-13T16:09:50Z", "created_date": "2022-05-10T15:36:32Z", "deposited_date": "2022-05-11T03:40:07Z", "accepted_date": null}

This paper examines the contingency effects of job-market conditions for career-motivated knowledge contributions in online collaboration communities. From the data of individual-level activities in a computer programming-related online Q&amp;A community (Stack Overflow), merged with job-market data for software developers, we find robust evidence of a positive association between community members’ career motivations and their knowledge contributions. More importantly, we find that this positive relationship is strengthened by job-market conditions: the number of vacancies in the job market, the expected salaries from these jobs, and the transparency in the flow of career-related information between the community and external recruiters. We contribute to the motivation literature in online collaboration communities by identifying and substantiating the role of contextual factors in mobilizing members’ career motivation. Our study thus offers novel insight into how career motivation can be effectively utilized to motivate contributors in these communities. Our findings also point to a possible paradigm change by characterizing online collaboration communities as emerging institutions for career motivation and skill signaling.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 5, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-08-28T12:09:13Z", "created_date": "2022-09-09T20:23:06Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:43Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, it also poses many demands on the user. Drawing on the challenge-hindrance stressor framework, this study develops a theory to explain how and why IS use stressors influence post-acceptance use. We identify two different types of IS use stressors: challenge IS use stressors and hindrance IS use stressors. We hypothesize that they are appraised through challenge IS use appraisal and hindrance IS use appraisal, respectively, through which they influence routine use and innovative use. We evaluate our hypotheses by surveying 178 users working in one organization and analyze the data collected using consistent partial least square (PLSc). We find that challenge IS use stressors positively influence routine use and innovative use via challenge IS use appraisal. Hindrance IS use stressors negatively influence routine use via hindrance IS use appraisal. We then dive deeper into these findings using a two-step fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), identifying the presence of challenge IS use stressors and challenge IS use appraisal as necessary conditions for high innovative use. We also reveal that the presence of hindrance IS use stressors and hindrance IS use appraisal only influences routine use and innovative use in the absence of challenge IS use stressors and challenge IS use appraisal. We discuss the practical relevance and transferability of our findings based on a comprehensive applicability check. Our findings advance IS scholarship of IS use stress and post-acceptance use by showing how routine use and innovative use emanate from IS use stressors.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 32, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-02T06:15:01Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T13:50:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T13:50:41Z", "accepted_date": null}

Because many of these guidelines have also been suggested for evaluating what good or rigorous research is, they may be used as a checklist in the review process. In this paper, we raise the question: To what extent do research guidelines for interpretive, mixed methods, and design science research offer evidence that they can be used to evaluate the quality of research. We argue that scholars can use these guidelines to evaluate what good research is if there is compelling evidence that they lead to certain good research outcomes. We use three well-known sets of guidelines as examples and argue that they do not seem to offer evidence that we can use them to evaluate the quality of research. Instead, the “evidence” is often an authority argument, popularity, or examples demonstrating the applicability of the guidelines. If many research method principles we regard as authoritative in IS are largely based on speculation and opinion, we should take these guidelines less seriously in evaluating the quality of research. Our proposal does not render the guidelines useless. If the guidelines cannot offer cause-and-effect evidence for the usefulness of their principles, we propose viewing the guidelines as idealizations for pedagogical purposes, which means that reviewers cannot use these guidelines as checklists to evaluate what good research is. While our examples are from interpretive, mixed methods, and design science research, we urge the IS community to ponder the extent to which other research method guidelines offer evidence that they can be used to evaluate the quality of research.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-04-18T10:29:42Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:03Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T17:03:15Z", "accepted_date": null}

However, little is known about what types of feedback are more effective in facilitating antiphishing training behavior and performance. The objectives of this study are to identify (1) the determinants of decision avoidance and detection accuracy, (2) the contextual effect of type of feedback in antiphishing training, (3) the impacts of perceived detection efficacy on training outcomes, and (4) the interaction effects between feedback characteristics and perceived detection efficacy/phishing characteristics on training outcomes. Drawing upon goal-setting theory, skill acquisition theory, and antiphishing training literature, our model provides a theoretical account of how feedback characteristics (e.g., type, quantity), phishing characteristics (e.g., phishing cue saliency), and perceived detection efficacy affect antiphishing training outcomes (e.g., decision avoidance and detection accuracy). To empirically test the model, we performed four experiments with 652 subjects in the United States from three different online panels via Amazon Mechanical Turk, Esearch.com, and Clickworker.com. Our results indicate that examplebased feedback is superior to abstract feedback in teaching how to correctly discern between phishing and legitimate emails in the context of link-embedded emails. We also show that perceived detection efficacy is essential for a better understanding of antiphishing training behavior and performance. Finally, we show an interaction effect between feedback quantity and phishing cue saliency on antiphishing training behavior and performance.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-10-01T15:37:46Z", "created_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:53Z", "deposited_date": "2024-07-06T08:51:03Z", "accepted_date": null}

Our method is grounded in network science and leverages the random surfer model of the web, small-world networks, strength of weak connections, and connectivity to analyze three types of large-scale networks. In doing so, we design features for structural hole assortativity and local clustering coefficient rank to capture both the diversity and evolution of user interests. We also extract general online community features such as size and overlap. Experiments conducted on a large dataset of 34,000 lists created and subscribed to by 1,600 active Twitter users over a six-month period showed that our network features outperform the general and content features in terms of recommending communities at the top position. In addition, a combination of general and network features generated the best results in the top position with a significant performance improvement over using only the content features. A combination of all three types of features gave the best results in the top-5 and top-10 positions while improving the quality of recommendations at every other position.

However, despite the abundance of extant literature, many studies still point to the lack of long-term sustainability of OCs. We contend that communities become dormant or obsolete over time because of manifestations of ineffectiveness a state of the community that hinders the attainment of individual and collective desired outcomes. While ineffectiveness in OCs is common, it is less apparent why such ineffectiveness persists. Two knowledge gaps are particularly significant here. First, while the multilevel nature of OCs is acknowledged, corresponding difficulties in aligning individual and collective interests and behaviors have often been neglected in past studies. Second, rare longitudinal studies have revealed that community members respond to ineffectiveness with various coping behaviors. However, the impact of these coping behaviors may not turn out as desired. Consequently, we investigate the persistence of ineffectiveness from the perspective of multilevel and coping effects, addressing the following research question: How and why does ineffectiveness persist in online communities? Our critical realist case study offers a three-step explanatory framework: (1) underlying multilevel tensions in the community contribute to usage ineffectiveness (i.e., members are unable to use the OC effectively); (2) misguided coping behaviors contribute to ineffective adaptation (i.e., members are unable to cope with not being able to use the OC effectively); and (3) ineffectiveness persists due to the interaction between usage and adaptation ineffectiveness.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-08T06:17:18Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T20:15:40Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T20:15:55Z", "accepted_date": null}

Drawing on more than 25 years of intensive, interventionist research engagement\nwith the digital transformation of public healthcare information management and delivery in more\nthan 80 countries in the Global South, we contribute to theorizing SDT in the form of a design theory\nconsisting of six interconnected design principles. These design principles articulate the interplay\nand tensions of accommodating over time increased diversity and flexibility in digital solutions,\nwhile simultaneously connecting local, national, and regional/ global efforts.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-06-13T07:29:19Z", "created_date": "2023-11-05T20:22:40Z", "deposited_date": "2023-11-07T09:52:51Z", "accepted_date": null}

Specifically, research on this topic has thus far overlooked the ambivalent implications of the specific demands placed on developers working in agile ISD teams, including potentially depleting effects. Drawing on ego depletion theory and the associated literature, we provide a more balanced view and introduce self-regulatory resource depletion triggered by using agile ISD practices—encompassing software development (SD) and project management (PM) practices—as a theoretical perspective on why agile developers experience different levels of work-related fatigue that lead to stronger or weaker turnover intentions. Furthermore, we propose that due to the specific way in which agile ISD methods organize ISD project work, developers’ perceived workload influences the intensity by which agile ISD practices affect self-regulatory resources and developers’ feelings of fatigue. We examined our research model using a multimethod approach including quantitative and qualitative data. We found that the use of agile SD practices enhances developers’ self-regulatory resources and reduces fatigue and turnover intention. Our results also show that perceived workload strengthens the energizing effects of the use of agile SD practices and reveals a depleting effect of the use of agile PM practices, with countervailing implications for turnover intention. This study contributes to agile ISD literature by drawing a more nuanced and balanced picture with both resource-enhancing and resource-draining effects of the use of agile ISD practices. Finally, we give managerial advice regarding factors to consider when designing and managing agile ISD projects.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 13, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-03T10:55:37Z", "created_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:44Z", "accepted_date": null}

Project leaders and stakeholders would strongly prefer that developers not only maintain but preferably increase their contributions over time as they gain experience. Corporations increasingly complement OSS developer motivations (such as fit in terms of shared values with the project community) by paying them to sustain contributions. However, practitioners argue whether payment helps or hurts projects because monetary compensation may dampen developer motivation in the long run, making it difficult for project leaders to understand what to expect from developers over time. Using Herzberg motivation-hygiene framework, we explore how developer perceptions of value fit with the project and being paid interact to determine the level of code contribution and its rate of change over time (i.e., growth). Using a survey of 564 developers across 431 projects on GitHub, we build a three-level growth model explaining the code contribution and its growth over a six-month period. We find that value fit with the project positively influences both the level and growth of code contribution. However, there are notable differences among paid and unpaid developers in the impact of value fit on their level and growth in code contributions over time. The implications of our work will be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and organizations investing in open source projects.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 12, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-25T16:11:24Z", "created_date": "2022-03-26T13:24:37Z", "deposited_date": "2022-03-26T16:15:48Z", "accepted_date": null}

A unique aspect of civic crowdfunding is that projects regularly attract a mix of individuals and organizations, spanning the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. This diversity of stakeholders raises novel questions and challenges for platform operators and fundraisers. Here, we focus on such challenges as they relate to third-party endorsements. A lengthy literature has examined the signaling value of endorsements and prominent lead contributions, typically treating their sources as homogeneous. However, the varied backgrounds, motivations, and objectives of stakeholders in civic crowdfunding suggest that endorsers’ signaling value is likely to vary. We theorize how onlookers’ (potential backers’ or donors’) perception of lead organizational donors’ motivations and fit with the project’s objectives will influence the latter’s signaling value, hypothesizing differences across lead donor types (i.e., businesses, governments, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]). Leveraging data on 303 projects from a leading civic crowdfunding platform, Spacehive, we show that lead donations are significantly more beneficial when supplied by NGOs rather than businesses or government entities. Further, based on perceptual measures reported by human coders about the more than 500 organizational lead donations in our sample, we confirm our theorized mechanisms, finding that lead donor involvement is more likely to be perceived as credible, and to lead to support for a project, when the lead’s involvement is believed to be a result of value motives (rather than strategic motives), and when the lead is a natural fit with the project (i.e., congruence). We discuss the implications of our work for both theory and practice.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2024-12-30T19:21:26Z", "created_date": "2024-07-06T08:50:53Z", "deposited_date": "2024-07-06T08:51:01Z", "accepted_date": null}

While social scientists have been quick to capitalize on the benefits of online experiments, information systems (IS) researchers seem to be among the laggards in taking advantage of this emerging paradigm, despite having the research motivations and technological capabilities to be among the leaders. A major reason for this gap is probably the secondary role traditionally attributed in IS research to experimental methods, as repeatedly demonstrated in methodological reviews of work published in major IS publication outlets. The purpose of this editorial is to encourage IS researchers interested in online behavior to adopt online experiments as a primary methodology, which may substitute for traditional lab experiments and complement nonexperimental methods. This purpose is pursued by analyzing why IS research has lagged behind neighboring disciplines in adopting experimental methods, what IS research can benefit from utilizing online experiments, and how IS research can reap these benefits.

Their growing prevalence engenders profound ethical challenges, which, we maintain, should be examined in a structured and theoretically informed fashion. However, much of the ethical exploration of ADMS within the IS field draws upon an atheoretical application of ethics. In this paper, we argue that the “big three” ethical theories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics can inform a structured comparative analysis of the ethical significance of ADMS. We demonstrate the value of such an approach through an illustrative case study of an ADMS in use by an Australian bank. Building upon this analysis, we address four characteristics of ADMS from the three theoretical perspectives, provide guidance on the contexts within which the application of each theory might be particularly fruitful, and highlight the advantages of theoretically grounded ethical analyses of ADMS.</jats:p>", "references": [], "reference_count": 0, "citation_count": 20, "publisher": "Association for Information Systems", "issn": ["1536-9323"], "subject": [], "license": [], "funder": [], "indexed_date": "2025-09-30T10:38:09Z", "created_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:39Z", "deposited_date": "2022-11-05T00:50:52Z", "accepted_date": null}
