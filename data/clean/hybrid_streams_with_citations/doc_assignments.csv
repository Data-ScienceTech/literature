the internal auditors role during the design phase of an edp application is unclear in many organizations this article integrates recent literature with the authors survey in an attempt to explain more precisely the potential roles of the internal auditor in the systems development process in practice four roles appear to exist in the order of their importance they are 1 audit of control adequacy 2 audit of design process 3 auditor as a user of the application and 4 auditor participant in the design process the rank ordering of these roles in practice is explainable in terms of three constraints upon internal audit involvement during the design phase the identified constraints are those of audit approach audit independence and management objectives although edp manager reaction to internal audit involvement is generally favorable it could be stronger upgrading of internal auditor expertise in edp systems appears to be the key to improved acceptance finally the potential contribution to the mis manager of internal audit involvement is noted and means of constructive interaction are suggested,The Internal Auditor's Role in MIS Developments,MIS Quarterly,1978.0,10.2307/248904,"[{'affiliation': array([], dtype=object), 'family': 'Rittenberg', 'given': 'Larry E.', 'sequence': 'first'}

jatspweak passwords are one of the most pervasive threats in cybersecurity facing this threat users require guidance on how to protect themselves a method frequently used by is practitioners and researchers to provide this guidance is fear appeals persuasive messages intended to prompt behavioral changes in response to a threat however previous research has not considered a key element of fear appeal effectiveness task primacy when fear appeals are a part of the primary or focal task users’ cognitive engagement will be high by default however when fear appeals are delivered as secondary tasks such as interruptive security messages users’ engagement is likely to be low because the primary task takes priority in attentional and cognitive resources in such cases a remedy is needed to elicit engagement with the fear appealjatsp jatspin this research note we theorize that cognitive engagement acts as a contextual moderator that is critical to the effectiveness of fear appeals under the boundary condition of task primacy further we theorize that interactivity a mechanism that adapts message content through tailored realtime feedback in response to a user’s actions is a key remedy to enhance engagement with fear appeals however to date fear appeals have largely been tested in noninteractive primary tasks and no study has provided a theoretical explanation for why interactivity enhances the power of a fear appealjatsp jatspwe empirically examined engagement as a contextual moderator in two ways first we conducted a field experiment which manipulated messages on a password creation form on a realworld website second we performed a qualitative focus group study to triangulate the experimental results and more fully reify our theoretical model together the findings reveal that interactivity acts as a catalyst to engage participants with a fear appeal which then allows the persuasive message of the fear appeal to be internalized the concepts of boundary condition of task primacy and engagement suggest ways that fear appeals can be more effectively applied in research and practicejatsp,Do Security Fear Appeals Work When They Interrupt Tasks?

jatspalthough financial fraud detection research has made impressive progress because of advanced machine learning algorithms constructing features or attributes that can effectively signal fraudulent behaviors remains a challenge in recent years a new type of fraud has emerged on peertopeer p2p lending platforms where individuals can borrow money from others without a financial intermediary in these markets the information asymmetry problem is seriously elevated inspired by the fraud triangle theory and its extensions and using the design science research methodology we construct five categories of behavioral features directly from p2p lending transaction data in addition to the baseline features regarding borrowers and loan requests these behavioral features are intended to capture the fraud capability integrity and opportunity of fraudsters based on their loan requests and payment histories connected peers bidding process characteristics and activity sequences using datasets from real users on two large p2p lending platforms in china our evaluation results show that combining these additional features with the baseline features significantly enhances detection performance this design science research contributes novel knowledge to the financial fraud detection literature and practicejatsp,Peer-to-Peer Loan Fraud Detection: Constructing Features from Transaction Data,MIS Quarterly,2022.0,10.25300/misq/2022/16103,"[{'affiliation': array([], dtype=object), 'family': 'Xu', 'given': 'Jennifer', 'sequence': 'first'}

jatspasthma is a common chronic health condition affecting millions of people in the united states while asthma cannot be cured it can be managed if we identify and understand triggers and risk factors that cause asthma exacerbations however this is challenging because these triggers and risk factors are complex and interconnected and there are limitations to current mainstream approaches for identifying them the recent availability of massive amounts of heterogeneous data has opened up new possibilities for asthma triggers and risk factors analyses in this study we introduce a datadriven framework adapt and integrate multiple advanced machine learning techniques and perform an empirical analysis to 1 derive characteristics of selfreported asthma patients from social media 2 enable integration and repurposing of highly heterogeneous and commonly available datasets and 3 uncover the sequential patterns of asthma triggers and risk factors and their relative importance both of which are difficult to achieve via retrospective cohortbased studies our methods and results can provide guidance for developing asthma management plans and interventions for specific subpopulations and eventually have the potential to reduce the societal burden of asthmajatsp,A Comprehensive Analysis of Triggers and Risk Factors for Asthma Based on Machine Learning and Large Heterogeneous Data Sources,MIS Quarterly,2020.0,10.25300/misq/2020/15106,"[{'affiliation': array(['Iowa State University'], dtype=object), 'family': 'Zhang', 'given': 'Wenli', 'sequence': 'first'}

jatspthis study examines the impact of coordination capabilities provided by enterprise systems es manifested in es standardization and extensiveness on merger and acquisition mampa outcomes in the short and long term specifically we examine the extent to which the es standardization and es extensiveness of the acquiring and target firms contribute to value creation in mampa initiatives we also study the relationship between the es standardization and es extensiveness of the acquiring and target firms and mampa offer premiums the empirical analysis suggests that the es standardization of acquirers is related to lower offer premiums and a higher market response to the acquisition for the acquirer however it is the es extensiveness of the acquirer that improves longterm performance ie decreases goodwill impairment and increases operating performance the analysis also indicates that the target’s es standardization increases the premium for the target firm and generates a positive market response to the acquisition for the target firm overall the analysis indicates that the es standardization likely affects the integration cost that influences market response to the mampa and to the mampa premium in the short term but it is es extensiveness that affects the realized synergy from the mampa that affects longterm performancejatsp,Enterprise Systems and M&amp;A Outcomes for Acquirers and Targets,MIS Quarterly,2022.0,10.25300/misq/2022/15994,"[{'affiliation': array([], dtype=object), 'family': 'Cao', 'given': 'Chengxin', 'sequence': 'first'}

jatsp“brickandmortar” retailers when expanding their businesses to online channels can either add a separate online channel or integrate channels to enhance service offerings although past studies on channel choice have yielded insights into factors affecting consumers’ channel preference there is a dearth of research that sheds light on when and why massive investments into channel integration would be preferred over online optimizations to this end we construct and validate a theoretical model that posits omnichannel integration services for acquisition and recovery as predictors of consumers’ online channel preference through influencing their perceptions of convenience and risk our experimental study reveals how distinct configurations of crosschannel service offerings affect consumers’ channel evaluations and decisions as well as how complementarities from channel integration across transaction and posttransaction phases can prevail over pure online substitutes consequently this study bridges diagnostic and prescriptive research streams on multichannel and omnichannel retail by attesting to channel integration as a viable channel differentiator from a practical standpoint we compare 12 distinct channel configurations with regard to consumers’ core evaluative criteria and highlight the value of omnichannel integration since efficiency improvements to the online channel can only serve as a partial substitute to channel integrationjatsp,Disentangling the Impact of Omnichannel Integration on Consumer Behavior in Integrated Sales Channels,MIS Quarterly,2020.0,10.25300/misq/2020/14121,"[{'affiliation': array([], dtype=object), 'family': 'Trenz', 'given': 'Manuel', 'sequence': 'first'}

jatspmany of the theories used in behavioral cybersecurity research have been applied with a nomothetic approach which is characterized by crosssectional data eg onetime surveys that identify patterns across a population of individuals although this can provide valuable betweenperson pointintime insights eg employees who use neutralization techniques such as denying responsibility for cybersecurity policy violations tend to comply less it is unable to reveal withinperson patterns that account for varying experiences and situations over time this paper articulates why an idiographic approach which undertakes a withinperson analysis of longitudinal data can 1 help validate widely used theories in behavioral cybersecurity research that imply patterns of behavior within a given person over time and 2 provide distinct theoretical insights on behavioral cybersecurity phenomena by accounting for such withinperson patterns to these ends we apply an idiographic approach to an established theory in behavioral cybersecurity research—neutralization theory—and empirically test a withinperson variant of this theory using a fourweek experience sampling study our results support a more granular application of neutralization theory in the cybersecurity context that considers the behavior of a given person over time we conclude the paper by highlighting the contexts and theories that provide the most promising opportunities for future behavioral cybersecurity research using an idiographic approachjatsp,Time Will Tell: The Case for an Idiographic Approach to Behavioral Cybersecurity Research,MIS Quarterly,2024.0,10.25300/misq/2023/17707,"[{'affiliation': array([], dtype=object), 'family': 'Cram', 'given': 'W.

this paper defines user adaptation as the cognitive and behavioral efforts performed by users to cope with significant information technology events that occur in their work environment drawing on coping theory we posit that users choose different adaptation strategies based on a combination of primary appraisal ie a users assessment of the expected consequences of an it event and secondary appraisal ie a users assessment of hisher control over the situation on that basis we identify four adaptation strategies benefits maximizing benefits satisficing disturbance handling and selfpreservation which are hypothesized to result in three different individuallevel outcomes restoring emotional stability minimizing the perceived threats of the technology and improving user effectiveness and efficiency a study of the adaptation behaviors of six account managers in two large north american banks provides preliminary support for our model by explaining adaptation patterns based on users initial appraisal and subsequent responses to an it event our model offers predictive power while retaining an agency view of user adaptation also by focusing on user cognitive and behavioral adaptation responses related to the technology the work system and the self our model accounts for a wide range of user behaviors such as technology appropriation avoidance and resistance,Understanding User Responses to Information Technology: A Coping Model of User Adaptation,MIS Quarterly,2005.0,10.2307/25148693,"[{'affiliation': array(['Concordia University'], dtype=object), 'family': 'Beaudry', 'given': '', 'sequence': 'first'}

calls for new directions in mis research bring with them a call for renewed methodological rigor this article offers an operating paradigm for renewal along dimensions previously unstressed the basic contention is that confirmatory empirical findings will be strengthened when instrument validation precedes both internal and statistical conclusion validity and that in many situations mis researchers need to validate their research instruments this contention is supported by a survey of instrumentation as reported in sample is journals over the last several years a demonstration exercise of instrument validation follows as an illustration of some of the basic principles of validation the validated instrument was designed to gather data on the impact of computer security administration on the incidence of computer abuse in the usa,Validating Instruments in MIS Research,MIS Quarterly,1989.0,10.2307/248922,"[{'affiliation': array(['University of Minnesota'], dtype=object), 'family': 'Straub', 'given': 'Detmar W.', 'sequence': 'first'}]","['https://openalex.org/W1485045604' 'https://openalex.org/W1510153396'
