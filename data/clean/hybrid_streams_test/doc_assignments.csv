the internal auditors role during the design phase of an edp application is unclear in many organizations this article integrates recent literature with the authors survey in an attempt to explain more precisely the potential roles of the internal auditor in the systems development process in practice four roles appear to exist in the order of their importance they are 1 audit of control adequacy 2 audit of design process 3 auditor as a user of the application and 4 auditor participant in the design process the rank ordering of these roles in practice is explainable in terms of three constraints upon internal audit involvement during the design phase the identified constraints are those of audit approach audit independence and management objectives although edp manager reaction to internal audit involvement is generally favorable it could be stronger upgrading of internal auditor expertise in edp systems appears to be the key to improved acceptance finally the potential contribution to the mis manager of internal audit involvement is noted and means of constructive interaction are suggested,The Internal Auditor's Role in MIS Developments,MIS Quarterly,1978.0,10.2307/248904,2,5,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","implementation, design, change, process, systems, model, users, user"

jatspweak passwords are one of the most pervasive threats in cybersecurity facing this threat users require guidance on how to protect themselves a method frequently used by is practitioners and researchers to provide this guidance is fear appeals persuasive messages intended to prompt behavioral changes in response to a threat however previous research has not considered a key element of fear appeal effectiveness task primacy when fear appeals are a part of the primary or focal task users’ cognitive engagement will be high by default however when fear appeals are delivered as secondary tasks such as interruptive security messages users’ engagement is likely to be low because the primary task takes priority in attentional and cognitive resources in such cases a remedy is needed to elicit engagement with the fear appealjatsp jatspin this research note we theorize that cognitive engagement acts as a contextual moderator that is critical to the effectiveness of fear appeals under the boundary condition of task primacy further we theorize that interactivity a mechanism that adapts message content through tailored realtime feedback in response to a user’s actions is a key remedy to enhance engagement with fear appeals however to date fear appeals have largely been tested in noninteractive primary tasks and no study has provided a theoretical explanation for why interactivity enhances the power of a fear appealjatsp jatspwe empirically examined engagement as a contextual moderator in two ways first we conducted a field experiment which manipulated messages on a password creation form on a realworld website second we performed a qualitative focus group study to triangulate the experimental results and more fully reify our theoretical model together the findings reveal that interactivity acts as a catalyst to engage participants with a fear appeal which then allows the persuasive message of the fear appeal to be internalized the concepts of boundary condition of task primacy and engagement suggest ways that fear appeals can be more effectively applied in research and practicejatsp,Do Security Fear Appeals Work When They Interrupt Tasks?

in the decision support systems literature most studies have concentrated on the direct effects of dss use and design on decision outcomes and user performance in the workplace fewer dss studies have integrated decision process variables such as user beliefs and attitudes in their models in this paper we examine the mediating role of decision process variables in the use of an online customer dss we do so through an experimental study of an alternativebased and an attributebased dss for product customization by online customers using cognitive fit and flow theories we develop a theoretical model with four mediating decision process variables perceived usefulness perceived ease of use perceived enjoyment and perceived control and two of their antecedents interface design attributebased versus alternativebased and task complexity choice set size our results show that the impact of dss interface design on behavioral intentions is fully mediated by perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment although not by perceived control specifically we verify that users of an attributebased dss express higher perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment than users of an alternativebased one in addition we find that task complexity has an interesting relationship with usefulness and enjoyment both of which follow an inverted ushaped curve as choice set size increases finally we find that for users of the alternativebased dss perceived ease of use and perceived control decrease as task complexity increases however the attributebased dss alleviates that decline for both variables among other contributions our results indicate the importance of including decision process variables when studying dss as well as the complex effect of task complexity on those variables our study also provides some important guidelines for online companies that provide customer dss on their websites especially the danger of providing too many product choice options that can overwhelm customers and harm their shopping experience,Using an Attribute-Based Decision Support System for User-Customized Products Online: An Experimental Investigation,MIS Quarterly,2008.0,10.2307/25148832,2,2,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","use, usage, perceived, usefulness, user, technology, ease, ease use"

employees in many contemporary organizations work with flexible routines and flexible technologies when those employees find that they are unable to achieve their goals in the current environment how do they decide whether they should change the composition of their routines or the materiality of the technologies with which they work the perspective advanced in this paper suggests that the answer to this question depends on how human and material agenciesthe basic building blocks common to both routines and technologiesare imbricated imbrication of human and material agencies creates infrastructure in the form of routines and technologies that people use to carry out their work routine or technological infrastructure used at any given moment is the result of previous imbrications of human and material agencies people draw on this infrastructure to construct a perception that a technology either constrains their ability to achieve their goals or that the technology affords the possibility of achieving new goals the case of a computer simulation technology for automotive design used to illustrate this framework suggests that perceptions of constraint lead people to change their technologies while perceptions of affordance lead people to change their routines this imbrication metaphor is used to suggest how a human agency approach to technology can usefully incorporate notions of material agency into its explanations of organizational change,"When Flexible Routines Meet Flexible Technologies: Affordance, Constraint, and the Imbrication of Human and Material Agencies",MIS Quarterly,2011.0,10.2307/23043493,2,5,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","implementation, design, change, process, systems, model, users, user"

jatspin today’s highly competitive business environment a growing number of hightech firms are opening their technologies we explore the rationale behind this unusual sharing behavior in order to understand whether it is altruism or a shrewd business move we construct an analytical model where competing firms can choose technology openness prototype release or technology closedness as the technology openness strategy and make subsequent innovations on the adopted technology in contrast to literature focusing on the demand side our study reveals a novel explanation by shedding light on two effects of supply side first openness generates an information effect through which it reveals technology information to the competitor second openness might also lead to an access effect in which the competitor might become a “copycat” by exerting a learning effort our analysis suggests that a firm’s openness decision depends upon the tradeoff between both effects and the interplay is moderated by the learning costs we find that sharing technology can alleviate costly innovation competition under certain conditions more importantly our results reveal that openness does not necessarily translate to higher innovation and greater consumer surplus as conventional wisdom suggests we also illustrate the robustness of the basic rationale and enrich our findings through several extended modelsjatsp,Altruism or Shrewd Business?

jatspherd literature suggests that people tend to discount their own beliefs and imitate others when making adoption decisions and that the resulting adoption decisions are fragile and can be easily reversed during the postadoptive stage this helps explain why the adoption of a number of new technologies―from amazon’s kindle to apple’s ipod iphone and ipad to various types of web 2 0 technologies―appears to have adoption patterns similar to those of new fashion trends i e an initial en masse acquisition followed by subsequent abandonment it is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology from a herd behavior perspective this study proposes two new concepts namely discounting one’s own information and imitating others to describe herd behavior in technology adoption a research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs how it impacts technology adoption decision making and how it influences postadoptive system use a longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one’s own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption however it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base as predicted in the herd literature instead imitation can help reduce postadoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance people tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the postadoptive stage findings from this study have significant research and practical implicationsjatsp,A Longitudinal Study of Herd Behavior in the Adoption and Continued Use of Technology1,MIS Quarterly,2013.0,10.25300/misq/2013/37.4.02,5,5,"adoption, app, auction, consumer, consumers, content, feedback, market, online, online reviews","adoption, market, technology adoption, technology, adopt, beliefs, advantages, behavior"

this paper describes the development of the technology threat avoidance theory ttat which explains individual it users behavior of avoiding the threat of malicious information technologies we articulate that avoidance and adoption are two qualitatively different phenomena and contend that technology acceptance theories provide a valuable but incomplete understanding of users it threat avoidance behavior drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory ttat delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes threat appraisal and coping appraisal to decide how to cope with it threats in the threat appraisal users will perceive an it threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious it and that the negative consequences are severe the threat perception leads to coping appraisal in which users assess the degree to which the it threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and selfefficacy of taking the safeguarding measure ttat posits that users are motivated to avoid malicious it when they perceive a threat and believe that the threat is avoidable by taking safeguarding measures if users believe that the threat cannot be fully avoided by taking safeguarding measures they would engage in emotionfocused coping integrating process theory and variance theory ttat enhances our understanding of human behavior under it threats and makes an important contribution to it security research and practice,Avoidance of Information Technology Threats: A Theoretical Perspective,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650279,5,1,"adoption, app, auction, consumer, consumers, content, feedback, market, online, online reviews","online, content, users, social, website, community, user, offline"

over the last three decades a significant stream of research in organizational behavior has established the importance of goals in regulating human behavior the precise degree of association between goals and action however remains an empirical question since people may for example make errors andor lack the ability to attain their goals this may be particularly true in dynamically complex task environments such as the management of software developmentto date goal setting research in the software engineering field has emphasized the development of tools to identify structure and measure software development goals in contrast there has been little microempirical analysis of how goals affect managerial decision behavior the current study attempts to address this research problem we investigated the impact of different project goals on software project planning and resource allocation decisions and in turn on project performance the research question was explored through a roleplaying project simulation game in which subjects played the role of software project managers two multigoal structures were tested one for costschedule and the other qualityschedule the costschedule group opted for smaller cost adjustments and was more willing to extend the project completion time the qualityschedule group on the other hand acquired a larger staff level in the later stages of the project and allocated a higher percentage of the larger staff level to quality assurance a costschedule goal led to lower cost while a qualityschedule goal led to higher quality these findings suggest that given specific software project goals managers do make planning and resource allocation choices in such a way that will meet those goals the implications of the results for project management practice and research are discussed,The Impact of Goals on Software Project Management: An Experimental Investigation,MIS Quarterly,1999.0,10.2307/249488,6,0,"application, code, communities, community, customization, designers, developers, development, dominant, followers","software, software development, development, performance, project, agile, autonomy, research"

information technology is generally considered an enabler of a firms agility a typical premise is that greater it investment enables a firm to be more agile however it is not uncommon that it can also hinder and sometimes even impede organizational agility we propose and theorize this frequently observed but understudied itagility contradiction by which it may enable or impede agility we develop the premise that organizations need to develop superior firmwide it capability to successfully manage their it resources to realize agility we refine the conceptualization and measurement of it capability as a latent construct reflected in its three dimensions it infrastructure capability it business spanning capability and it proactive stance we also conceptualize two types of organizational agility market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility we then conduct a matchedpair field survey of business and information systems executives in 128 organizations to empirically examine the link between a firms it capability and agility business executives responded to measurement scales of the two types of agility and organizational context variables and is executives responded to measurement scales of it capabilities and is context variables the results show a significant positive relationship between it capability and the two types of organizational agility we also find a significant positive joint effect of it capability and it spending on operational adjustment agility but not on market capitalizing agility the findings suggest a possible resolution to the contradictory effect of it on agility while more it spending does not lead to greater agility spending it in such a way as to enhance and foster it capabilities does our study provides initial empirical evidence to better understand essential it capabilities and their relationship with organizational agility our findings provide a number of useful implications for research and managerial practices,Understanding the Link Between Information Technology Capability and Organizational Agility: An Empirical Examination,MIS Quarterly,2011.0,10.2307/41409967,2,1,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","firms, innovation, firm, capability, performance, capabilities, information, investment"

although research on threedimensional virtual environments abounds little is known about the social and business aspects of virtual worlds given the emergence of largescale social virtual worlds such as second life and the dramatic growth in sales of virtual goods it is important to understand the dynamics that govern the purchase of virtual goods in virtual worlds employing the stimulusorganismresponse sor framework we investigate how technological interactivity and sociability and spatial density and stability environments in virtual worlds influence the participants virtual experiences telepresence social presence and flow and how experiences subsequently affect their response intention to purchase virtual goods the results of our survey of 354 second life residents indicate that interactivity which enhances the interaction with objects has a significant positive impact on telepresence and flow also sociability which fosters interactions with participants is significantly associated with social presence although no such significant impact was observed on flow furthermore both density and stability are found to significantly influence participants virtual experiences stability helps users to develop strong social bonds thereby increasing both social presence and flow however contrary to our prediction of curvilinear patterns density is linearly associated with flow and social presence interestingly the results exhibit two opposing effects of density while it reduces the extent of flow density increases the amount of social presence since social presence is found to increase flow the net impact of density on flow depends heavily on the relative strength of the associations involving these three constructs finally we find that flow mediates the impacts of technological and spatial environments on intention to purchase virtual products we conclude the paper with a discussion of the theoretical and practical contributions of our findings,An Odyssey into Virtual Worlds: Exploring the Impacts of Technological and Spatial Environments on Intention to Purchase Virtual Products,MIS Quarterly,2011.0,10.2307/23042809,2,3,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","social, network, digital, social network, networking, virtual, networks, trust"

two objectives in the design of decision support systems dss are to improve decisionmaking performance and to use dss modeling forms that are natural that is to adopt modeling paradigms that are congruent with decision makers conceptual models of decision tasks by accomplishing the latter objective a dss should enjoy better conceptual ease of use and face validity however past research finds that dss deemed natural for a task by decision makers dss designers and researchers alike often do not improve or even hinder performance the inverse also occurs further decisionmaking behavior seems quite sensitive to minor task differences how reliably are decision model natural ness and performance related this study utilizes the bootstrapping paradigm of psychological research to help answer this question in assessing the naturalness and performance of differing model paradigms over time and across levels of task complexity no single systematic pattern emerges but the results suggest that naturalness and performance are differentially sensitive to task contingencies for example while relative performance is stable over time only in the low complexity condition relative naturalness is stable over time only int the intermediate complexity condition one implication of the results is that conceptual ease of use may be an unreliable predictor of a dsss effect on performance dss mechanisms may help decision makers better analyze model naturalness and performance,A Study of the Relationship between Decision Model Naturalness and Performance,MIS Quarterly,1989.0,10.2307/248924,3,-1,"decision, dss, decision making, making, decision makers, makers, support, decision support",

jatsphate speech is a major problem on social media platforms automatic hate speech detection methods relying on machine learning models which learn from manually labeled datasets have been proposed in both academia and industry however there is increasing evidence that hate speech detection datasets labeled by general annotators eg amateurs or mturk workers contain systematic bias as they cannot effectively consider language use differences among different speakers when such biased datasets are used to train machine learning models the resulting models will also be biased unlike general annotators experts can produce much less biased annotations however expert annotations cannot be efficiently obtained in large quantity this paper bridges the gap by adopting a weakly supervised learning method for hate speech detection using a small number of expert annotations we propose a novel design that uses contrastive learning and promptbased learning based on large language models incorporating a group estimator a pair generator and knowledge injection using realworld twitter posts written by african american english speakers and other racial groups as an example extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method the proposed approach was also evaluated on data in the lgbtq community and achieved consistent results the study has important academic and practical implications for hate speech detection and large language modelsjatsp,Relieving Bias in Hate Speech Detection with a Small Number of Expert Annotations: A Prompt-based Learning Approach,MIS Quarterly,2025.0,10.25300/misq/2025/18416,0,5,"anxiety, bias, breaches, collaborative, compliance, computer, computer selfefficacy, cybersecurity, data, data processing","models, method, fraud, bias, detection, predictive, model, approach"
negotiation is increasingly being conducted over computer media such as email and instant messaging because of the potential for time savings and monetary benefits however these media can affect negotiators behaviors as they engage in what is called concession making which is a process by which they make offers that yield benefits to their opponents in this paper we focus on how and why conducting negotiations via computer media can affect this process especially when negotiators have unequal power our research model is based on theories from the information systems negotiation and social psychology literatures via a laboratory experiment we find that concessions made by the first individual to make an offer the first mover were not typically reciprocated by hisher negotiating opponent the second mover thus in the context of computermediated negotiation it appears that second movers are among other things more likely to violate the wellestablished norm of reciprocity this can result in significant disadvantages for the first mover independent of power differences between negotiators in addition we find that contrary to facetoface negotiations increased power of one negotiator resulted in hisher having less influence in terms of getting larger concessions from the other negotiator in general these findings support the notion that computermediated negotiation can be significantly different than facetoface negotiation,Power and Concession in Computer-Mediated Negotiations: An Examination of First Offers,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650282,9,5,"communication, computermediated, content, crowd, engagement, facetoface, fake, false, groups, intelligence","facetoface, media, computermediated, groups, differences, power, hisher, second"

jatspthe literature on information technology it and government corruption in developing countries indicates contradictory evidence about the realization of anticorruption effects so far there is no theoretical explanation of why the anticorruption potential of it demonstrated in some countries is not realized in many other countries drawing evidence from a case study of information systems interventions at ghana customs over 35 years we investigate how and why it’s anticorruption potential may be curtailed in the context of developing countries’ governments and societies we focus on itmediated petty corruption practices of streetlevel officers which we consider to be socially embedded and institutionally conditioned phenomena we find that conditions of possibility for the itmediated petty corruption practices are created during the implementation of information systems the configuration of it and organizational processes of a government agency are constrained by the broader government administration system and influenced by the vested interests of government officers politicians and businesses subsequently the cooptation of it for petty corruption practices is enabled by networks of relationships and institutions of patronage that extend across government business and society we thus explain the often limited effects of it on petty corruption as the inability of localized information systems implementations to change modes of government administration that are embedded in the enduring neopatrimonial institutions and politics of many developing countriesjatsp,Information Technology and Government Corruption in Developing Countries: Evidence from Ghana Customs,MIS Quarterly,2021.0,10.25300/misq/2021/14838,2,0,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","research, information, information systems, theory, systems, researchers, paper, action"

given that adoption of a new system often implies fully or partly replacing an incumbent system resistance is often manifested as failure of a user to switch from an incumbent technology to a newly introduced one thus a potential source of resistance to adopting a new system lies in the use of an incumbent system using the status quo bias and habit literatures as theoretical lenses the study explains how use of an incumbent system negatively impacts new system perceptions and usage intentions we argue that habitual use of an incumbent system rationalization due to perceived transition costs and psychological commitment due to perceived sunk costs all encourage development of inertia inertia in turn fully mediates the impact of these incumbent system constructs on constructs related to acceptance of the new system via psychological commitment based on cognitive consistency and by increasing the importance of normative pressures specifically we hypothesize that inertia leads to decreased perceptions of the ease of use and relative advantage of a newly introduced system and has a negative impact on intentions to use the new system above and beyond its impact through perceptions finally we hypothesize that inertia moderates the relationship between subjective norm and intention such that normative pressures to use a new system become more important in the presence of inertia empirical results largely support the hypothesized relationships showing the inhibiting effect of incumbentsystem habit transition and sunk costs and inertia on acceptance of a new system our study thus extends theoretical understanding of the role of incumbent system constructs such as habit and inertia in technology acceptance and lays the foundations for further study of the interplay between perceptions and cognition with respect to the incumbent system and those with respect to a new system,"Shackled to the Status Quo: The Inhibiting Effects of Incumbent System Habit, Switching Costs, and Inertia on New System Acceptance",MIS Quarterly,2012.0,10.2307/41410404,2,2,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","use, usage, perceived, usefulness, user, technology, ease, ease use"

jatsprecommender systems have become the cornerstone of electronic marketplaces that sell products from competing sellers similar to traditional advertising recommender systems can introduce consumers to new products and increase the market size which benefits sellers this informative role of recommender systems in electronic marketplaces seems attractive to sellers because sellers do not pay the marketplaces for receiving recommendations we show that in a marketplace that deploys a recommender system helping consumers discover the product that provides them the highest expected net utility sellers do not necessarily benefit from the “free” exposure provided by the recommender system the impacts of the recommender system are the result of a subtle interaction between advertising effect and competition effect the advertising effect causes sellers to advertise less on their own and the competition effect causes them to decrease prices in the presence of a recommender system essentially sellers “pay” in the form of more intense price competition because of the recommender system furthermore the competition effect is exacerbated by the advertising effect because the recommender system alters a seller’s own strategies related to advertising intensity and price from being strategic substitutes in the absence of the recommender system to being strategic complements in its presence as a result of these two effects we find that sellers are more likely to benefit from the recommender system only when it has a high precision the results do not change qualitatively whether sellers use targeted advertising or uniform advertising however we find that a recommender system that benefits sellers when they do not employ targeted advertising may actually hurt them when they adopt targeted advertising with a high precision on the other hand in the presence of the recommender system an increase in sellers’ targeting precision beyond a threshold softens price competition increases seller profits and reduces consumer surplus finally we find that when the recommender system assigns a larger weight to product fit than price the adverse impacts of the recommender system on sellers are mitigated thereby expanding the region in the parameter space where the recommender system is beneficial to sellersjatsp,Informative Role of Recommender Systems in Electronic Marketplaces: A Boon or a Bane for Competing Sellers,MIS Quarterly,2020.0,10.25300/misq/2020/14614,5,3,"adoption, app, auction, consumer, consumers, content, feedback, market, online, online reviews","sellers, auction, feedback, price, markets, buyers, market, trust"

jatspleveraging a combination of analytical frameworks and empirical assessments this study investigates the effects of waitforfree wff pricing schemes on the monetization of serialized digital entertainment content which has become increasingly pervasive on online platforms wff pricing is a strategy in which consumers are given the option to either wait a certain amount of time to acquire digital content at no cost or pay to consume it immediately we evaluate the extent to which habit formation and presentbiased preferences driven by the consumption of addictive stock affect individual consumers’ willingness to wait or pay for content which in turn determines the efficacy of wff pricing we also examine the conditions under which consumers switch from waiting for free content to instantaneously purchasing content our findings indicate that wff pricing increases the sales of serialized digital content generating new demand from customers who would otherwise forgo participation in the market in addition the pricing design effectively generates sustained profits in the long run we found that most consumers who initiate a purchase either upon initial market entry or upon switching continue to purchase as new episodes become available moreover the results indicate that as a user accumulates free episodes of a specific series given extended waiting periods the likelihood of their conversion from a waitforfree customer to an instantpurchase customer increases in particular wff pricing effectively augments the willingness to pay of lowvaluation consumers as habit formation builds up through time with the free consumption of serialized content one free episode can elevate the likelihood of consumer purchase by up to 13 however as the number of free episodes consumed goes beyond a threshold the likelihood of conversion decreases we conclude with a discussion of managerial implications that can help content providers monetize their serialized digital content productsjatsp,The Cost of Free: The Effects of “Wait-for-Free” Pricing Schemes on the Monetization of Serialized Digital Content,MIS Quarterly,2023.0,10.25300/misq/2022/17196,5,1,"adoption, app, auction, consumer, consumers, content, feedback, market, online, online reviews","online, content, users, social, website, community, user, offline"

online users often need to make adoption decisions without accurate information about the product values an informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an online user having observed others actions to follow the adoption decision of the preceding individual without regard to his own information informational cascades are often rational for individual decision making however it may lead to adoption of inferior products with easy availability of information about other users choices the internet offers an ideal environment for informational cascades in this paper we empirically examine informational cascades in the context of online software adoption we find user behavior in adopting software products is consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature our results demonstrate that online users choices of software products exhibit distinct jumps and drops with changes in download ranking as predicted by informational cascades theory furthermore we find that user reviews have no impact on user adoption of the most popular product while having an increasingly positive impact on the adoption of lower ranking products the phenomenon persists after controlling for alternative explanations such as network effects wordofmouth effects and product diffusion our results validate informational cascades as an important driver for decision making on the internet the finding also offers an explanation for the mixed results reported in prior studies with regard to the influence of online user reviews on product sales we show that the mixed results could be due to the moderating effect of informational cascades,Informational Cascades and Software Adoption on the Internet: An Empirical Investigation,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650277,5,5,"adoption, app, auction, consumer, consumers, content, feedback, market, online, online reviews","adoption, market, technology adoption, technology, adopt, beliefs, advantages, behavior"

the internet has the potential to fundamentally change the structure of marketing channels but only if consumers choose to adopt electronic channels thus this paper aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of consumer channel choices specifically it contends that it is important to examine consumers intent to adopt electronic channels not as a monolithic decision but as a choice they make at each of four stages in the purchase process requirements determination vendor selection purchase and aftersales service innovation diffusion theory suggests that consumers make adoption decisions based on their perceptions of the relative advantage of the innovation the relative advantage of electronic channels is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct involving a cumulative assessment of the perceived relative merits of channels on three dimensions convenience trust and efficacy of information acquisition combining the multidimensional nature of relative advantage with the multistage purchase process the central assertion and intended contribution of this paper is to show that the relative advantage of electronic channels and the influence of each dimension of relative advantage on the adoption of electronic channels will vary across the different stages of the purchase process survey data were collected from faculty and staff at a large university about their intention to use the web for auto insurance transactions the results provide support for the multidimensional nature of relative advantage although the emergent factors do not align neatly with the hypothesized dimensions convenience trust and efficacy of information acquisition or stages results of the study support three conclusions first the dimensions along which consumers assess relative advantage blend hypothesized dimensions such as trust and convenience with stages of the purchase process second consumers consider the relative advantage of channels at two distinct stages of the purchase process gathering information and executing the transaction third different dimensions of relative advantage are critical in predicting consumer channel choice at each stage,The Relative Advantage of Electronic Channels: A Multidimensional View,MIS Quarterly,2008.0,10.2307/25148833,2,4,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","service, customer, customers, service quality, customer service, quality, employees, channels"

jatspdespite the increasing connectivity between consumers and the large volume of social shares supported by digital technologies there is an absence of research systematically investigating how firms can design promotional incentives that jointly consider their consumers as both purchasers and sharers in this study we examine whether and how firms can leverage consumers’ social connections and engage consumers to share promotional incentives in collaboration with a leading online deal platform we report a largescale randomized field experiment to test the effectiveness of different incentive designs varying in the shareability and scarcity of promotion codes in driving social sharing senders’ purchases and successful referrals we find that the different incentive designs have distinct impacts on the purchase and referral outcomes specifically providing senders with one nonshareable promo code significantly increases their own purchase likelihood compared to the other experimental groups in contrast senders who receive one shareable promo code are less likely to purchase themselves yet are more likely to make successful referrals surprisingly the incentive design with two promo codes containing one nonshareable code and one shareable code increases neither the senders’ purchases nor their successful referrals managerially we estimate that although the one nonshareable promo code group derives the highest net revenue for the experimental period the one shareable promo code group derives the highest customer lifetime value for the firm from the new customers acquired through the successful referrals we further conducted two online experiments on amazon mechanical turk that replicate the field experiment’s findings and explore the underlying mechanisms of the observed relationships we find that exclusivity perception and social motives triggered by the incentive designs with one promo code mediate their effects on senders’ selfpurchases and successful referrals respectively and explain the ineffectiveness of two promo codes our study contributes to the bodies of literature on itenabled social sharing and social promotions providing implications for firms on how to design promotional incentives that accommodate the dual role of consumers as purchasers and sharersjatsp,Designing Promotional Incentives to Embrace Social Sharing: Evidence from Field and Online Experiments,MIS Quarterly,2021.0,10.25300/misq/2021/15352,2,3,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","social, network, digital, social network, networking, virtual, networks, trust"
jatspsoftware firms are increasingly adopting an open source strategy allowing them to leverage the effort exerted by the open source community toward improving software quality in addition to embracing a proprietary or fully open source strategy several firms choose a partial openness strategy wherein only certain parts of the code are open source while the rest is proprietary specifically when adopting a partial openness strategy a firm may choose to make the core software code open source while keeping the extension software code proprietary or keep the core proprietary and make the extension open source when making decisions related to different openness strategies firms need to take into account the level of effort they are exerting toward the improvement of the quality of software the level of engagement of the open source community and pricing hence the decisions related to a firm’s openness strategy are not straightforward while this is an important question for many firms it has not been analyzed in the literature in this research we attempt to fill this important gap by analyzing different openness strategies in the context of resource allocation for fixing defects specifically using a gametheoretic model we explore when a firm should make its software fully open source or partially open source and when it should keep it proprietary our results show that when the baseline demand for the firm increases with the extent of openness the firm should either make its software fully open or keep it proprietary and importantly should not rely on partial openness next in scenarios where customers are highly sensitive to security risks the demand loss to efficiency gain ratio has an important role in determining a firm’s optimal openness strategies these findings provide important insights to firms on how to effectively plan their openness strategies and also establish a basis for future research on the topic of partial opennessjatsp,Dynamics of Competition on Openness Strategies and Software Maintenance,MIS Quarterly,2024.0,10.25300/misq/2023/17063,6,1,"application, code, communities, community, customization, designers, developers, development, dominant, followers","open source, open, source, projects, firm, community, proprietary, object"

jatspthe importance of pursuing financial inclusion to accelerate economic growth and enhance financial sustainability has been well noted however studies have provided few actionable insights into how financial institutions can balance the potential socioeconomic tradeoff between profitability and equality one major challenge arises from a lack of understanding of the impacts of various types of market information available on financial equality beyond economic profitability another challenge lies in how the socioeconomic tradeoff under a large set of counterfactual policies in a realworld setting can be evaluated our motivation for the present study was the emerging sources of digitized userbehavior data ie “alternative data” stemming from the high penetration of mobile devices and internet access accordingly we investigated how alternative data from smartphones and social media can help mitigate potential financial inequality while preserving business profitability in the context of financial credit risk assessment we partnered with a leading microloan website to design a novel “meta” experiment that allowed us to simulate various realworld field experiments under an exhaustive set of counterfactual policies interestingly we found that profiling user financial risk using smartphone activities is 13 times more effective in improving financial inclusion than using online social media information 2305 better vs 1811 and nearly 13 times more effective in improving business profitability 42 better vs 33 surprisingly we found that using consumers’ online shopping activities for credit risk profiling can hurt financial inclusion furthermore we investigated potential explanations for financial inclusion improvements our findings suggest that alternative data especially users’ smartphone activities not only demonstrate higher ubiquity but also appear to be more orthogonal to conventional sensitive demographic attributes this in turn can help mitigate statistical bias driven by the unobserved factors or underrepresentative training samples in machinebased risk assessment processesjatsp,Profit vs. Equality?

jatsptopic models are becoming a frequently employed tool in the empirical methods repertoire of information systems and management scholars given textual corpora such as consumer reviews and online discussion forums researchers and business practitioners often use topic modeling to either explore data in an unsupervised fashion or generate variables of interest for subsequent econometric analysis however one important concern stems from the fact that topic models can be notorious for their instability ie the generated results could be inconsistent and irreproducible at different times even on the same dataset therefore researchers might arrive at potentially unreliable results regarding the theoretical relationships that they are testing or developing in this paper we attempt to highlight this problem and suggest a potential approach to addressing it first we empirically define and evaluate the stability problem of topic models using four textual datasets next to alleviate the problem and with the goal of extracting actionable insights from textual data we propose a new method stable lda which incorporates topical word clusters into the topic model to steer the model inference toward consistent results we show that the proposed stable lda approach can significantly improve model stability while maintaining or even improving the topic model quality further employing two case studies related to an online knowledge community and online consumer reviews we demonstrate that the variables generated from stable lda can lead to more consistent estimations in econometric analyses we believe that our work can further enhance management scholars’ collective toolkit to analyze evergrowing textual datajatsp,Extracting Actionable Insights from Text Data: A Stable Topic Model Approach,MIS Quarterly,2023.0,10.25300/misq/2022/16957,0,5,"anxiety, bias, breaches, collaborative, compliance, computer, computer selfefficacy, cybersecurity, data, data processing","models, method, fraud, bias, detection, predictive, model, approach"

this paper expands refines and explicates media synchronicity theory originally proposed in a conference proceeding in 1999 dennis and valacich 1999 media synchronicity theory mst focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together we expand on the original propositions of mst to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes conveyance and convergence the familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance for convergence processes use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance we identify five capabilities of media symbol sets parallelism transmission velocity rehearsability and reprocessability that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes the successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task rather than just one medium,"Media, Tasks, and Communication Processes: A Theory of Media Synchronicity",MIS Quarterly,2008.0,10.2307/25148857,9,2,"communication, computermediated, content, crowd, engagement, facetoface, fake, false, groups, intelligence","media, managers, selection, communication, use, directors, rich, performing"

the interaction of formal information systems and organizational decision models will be examined in this article it is conjectured that decision models and processes not only determine the information requirements but that they are influenced by the organizational information systems that are designed to support them t his type of circular relationship between the decision models and the information systems undermines the success of requirements analysis which traditionally views information systems as supporting structures for the decision models and ignores their counter effect on the decision models four different examples are presented to demonstrate the effect of information systems on organizational decision models the examples range form algorithmic to highly unstructured and speculative but they all suggest that informationintensive models are qualitatively different from their informationpoor counterparts,Information Intensive Modeling,MIS Quarterly,1987.0,10.2307/248828,0,5,"anxiety, bias, breaches, collaborative, compliance, computer, computer selfefficacy, cybersecurity, data, data processing","models, method, fraud, bias, detection, predictive, model, approach"
the failure of the mis idea to achieve its ultimate goal of informing mangers rests in the single wrong assumption that the manager can define his information needs prior to the time for decision making if the assumption were true then management could be implemented by automata because it is not true the conventional mis maximum capability is to produce hackneyed status reports based upon technocrats perceptions of what the manager needs its minimum capability is coughing up answers to irrelevant unasked questions this spectrum from impotence to mediocrity cannot be usefully extended to meet managements needs because the design strategy is wrong a proper design strategy for providing managers with relevant information for choosing courses of action recognizes the principle of variety reduction and that human beings have unique and peculiar ways of reducing variety in noisy information circumstances assuming that the distinguishing feature beyond luck of the successful executive vs the controller is creativity including novel and nonstructured uses of information then any structured reporting system will fail to meet his needs this article describes the design criteria for and the successful implementation of a system to support decision making in an information rich and volatile environment the independent practice association form of health maintenance organization issues of cost and quality of medical care the measurement of professional practice the assumption of risk etc combine with an abundance of difficult data processing procedures to make this job a worthy challenge and its successful implementation a model for complex organizations,The Executive Intelligence System as a Design Strategy,MIS Quarterly,1979.0,10.2307/249045,3,-1,"decision, dss, decision making, making, decision makers, makers, support, decision support",
aging information systems are expensive to maintain and most are eventually retired and replaced but what determines in the choices made by managers whether and when a system reaches endoflife what shapes managers judgements about a systems remaining life expectancy and do these judgments influence the maintenance effort itself system maintenance and prospective replacement are examined here in new terms positing that managers equilibrate balance their allocation of maintenance effort with their expectations of a systems remaining life drawing from data on 758 systems among 54 organizations support is found for an exploratory structural equation model in which the relationship between maintenance effort and remaining life expectancy is newly explained a portfolio effect reflecting a systems familial complexity is also found to be directly and positively related to the maintenance effort a further finding is that a systems size is directly and positively associated with its remaining life expectancy notwithstanding normative research suggesting the contrary larger systems may tend to be longerlived than smaller systems practically the suggestion is made that better documented and monitored portfolios together with regular periodic performance assessments can lead to better management of systems life cycles,System Life Expectancy and the Maintenance Effort: Exploring Their Equilibration,MIS Quarterly,2000.0,10.2307/3250939,1,0,"advantage, article describes, competitive, competitive advantage, describes, development, executives, information, information systems, issues","systems, development, information systems, systems development, information, maintenance, application, article"

evolutionary psychology holds great promise as one of the possible pillars on which information systems theorizing can take place arguably evolutionary psychology can provide the key to many counterintuitive predictions of behavior toward technology because many of the evolved instincts that influence our behavior are below our level of conscious awareness often those instincts lead to behavioral responses that are not selfevident this paper provides a discussion of information systems theorizing based on evolutionary psychology centered on key human evolution and evolutionary genetics concepts and notions it is argued here that there is often a need to integrate evolutionary and nonevolutionary theories and four important preconditions for the successful integration of evolutionary and nonevolutionary theories are discussed an example of integration of evolutionary and nonevolutionary theories is provided the example focuses on one evolutionary information systems theorymedia naturalness theorypreviously developed as an alternative to media richness theory and one nonevolutionary information systems theory channel expansion theory,Information Systems Theorizing Based on Evolutionary Psychology: An Interdisciplinary Review and Theory Integration Framework,MIS Quarterly,2009.0,10.2307/20650297,2,0,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","research, information, information systems, theory, systems, researchers, paper, action"
while many large businesses start out as a small enterprise remarkably little is known about how an organization actually changes internally during the periods of growth small business growth is known to strain internal communication processes for example which likely limits growth opportunities information systems are often called upon to remedy such deficiencies through a participatory action research project we investigated the ways in which a small business management team developed an isenabled solution to address their growth needs during the progression of the project a new outcome of organizational effectiveness internal transparency was identified and developed adopting a punctuated equilibrium perspective a theoretical process model is proposed that sheds light on a relationship between internal transparency small business growth and is the paper concludes with observations that internal transparency may well be a concept that offers significant potential for mis research as well as a discussion about the applicability and credibility of participatory action research for this project,Small Business Growth and Internal Transparency: The Role of Information Systems,MIS Quarterly,2004.0,10.2307/25148647,2,0,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","research, information, information systems, theory, systems, researchers, paper, action"

the role of frameworks in information systems has recently received a great deal of critical attention one prominent indictment which has been directed at even commonly accepted frameworks is that they lack empirical support and in fact are not constructed in operational terminology this article reports the results of an experimental lab study using mba students as subjects to investigate the tenants of the gorry and scott morton framework gorry and scott morton 1971 while firm support is found for the assumption that the level of information attributes varies across system type in the direction postulated there is evidence that the ability to differentiate the component attributes is affected by such factors as field dependency and mode of presentation,An Experimental Validation of the Gorry and Scott Morton Framework,MIS Quarterly,1989.0,10.2307/248926,2,0,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","research, information, information systems, theory, systems, researchers, paper, action"
the increasing dependence on information networks for business operations has focused managerial attention on managing risks posed by failure of these networks in this paper we develop models to assess the risk of failure on the availability of an information network due to attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities software vulnerabilities arise from software installed on the nodes of the network when the same software stack is installed on multiple nodes on the network software vulnerabilities are shared among them these shared vulnerabilities can result in correlated failure of multiple nodes resulting in longer repair times and greater loss of availability of the network considering positive network effects eg compatibility alone without taking the risks of correlated failure and the resulting downtime into account would lead to overinvestment in homogeneous software deployment exploiting characteristics unique to information networks we present a queuing model that allows us to quantify downtime loss faced by a rm as a function of 1 investment in security technologies to avert attacks 2 software diversification to limit the risk of correlated failure under attacks and 3 investment in it resources to repair failures due to attacks the novelty of this method is that we endogenize the failure distribution and the node correlation distribution and show how the diversification strategy and other security measuresinvestments may impact these two distributions which in turn determine the security loss faced by the firm we analyze and discuss the effectiveness of diversification strategy under different operating conditions and in the presence of changing vulnerabilities we also take into account the benefits and costs of a diversification strategy our analysis provides conditions under which diversification strategy is advantageous,"Correlated Failures, Diversification, and Information Security Risk Management",MIS Quarterly,2011.0,10.2307/23044049,2,3,"capability, change, customer, customers, design, digital, firm, firms, implementation, information","social, network, digital, social network, networking, virtual, networks, trust"
